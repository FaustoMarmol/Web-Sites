          <tr>
            <td><p>              Hypnosis and hypnotic phenomena are integral 
              aspects of certain shamanic practices. The use 
              of hypnotic methods can be identified in ancient 
              shamanistic traditions from around the
              world, long before hypnosis was formally introduced
              into modern Western society (e.g., Teitelbaum
              1978; Bowers 1976). This close relationship
              between shamanism and hypnosis can
              be clearly observed in at least two areas of the
              shamanic complex. First, both shamanism in its
              healing rituals and hypnosis in its therapeutic<br />
              encounter rely essentially on the skillful manipulation
              of the patient&rsquo;s imagination in order to
              achieve the desired therapeutic benefits. Accordingly,
              shamanic healing and clinical hypnosis
              can be jointly defined as the &ldquo;masterful
              presentation of ideas [by the hypnotist or
              shaman] in order to manipulate images in the
              subject or client, all for the purpose of causing
              deliberate physiological and/or psychological
              responses to take place&rdquo; (Overton 1998, 167).</p>
              <p> The second aspect shared by both shamanism
                and hypnosis the representative use of the same
                dissociative state of consciousness, which in
                shamanism is referred to as the shamanic journey,
                or ecstatic flight, and in hypnosis is called
                the hypnotic trance, or simply trance. Neurophysiological
                and empirical evidence support
                the view that the shamanic journey achieved
                without the use of hallucinogenic substances,
                that is, with the aid of musical instrumentation,
                chanting, and similar phenomena, elicits
                the same electroencephalographic profile as the
                hypnotic trance state. In addition, experiential
                phenomena characteristic of the shaman&rsquo;s ecstatic
                flight, such as shapeshifting, contact with
                imaginal agents, and the like, can likewise be
                achieved in hypnotic trance (see Overton 1998,
                2000).</p>
              <p>The role of trance and imagination in hypnosis 
                is not always self-evident from the definitions
                of hypnosis that have been given, which
                vary greatly. Hypnosis has been defined as &ldquo;any
                effective communication&rdquo; (Grinder and Bandler
                1981, 2), &ldquo;a state of mind in which suggestions
                are acted upon much more powerfully
                than is possible under normal circumstances&rdquo;
                (Alman and Lambrou 1992, 7), and &ldquo;ideas
                evoking responses&rdquo; (Bierman 1995, 65). Each
                of these definitions illustrates differing views on<br />
                the relationship between hypnosis and trance,
                an association that is often not clearly understood,
                although the latter is frequently implicitly
                viewed as equivalent to the former. However,
                although the use of trance with patients is
                central to the manner in which hypnotherapy
                is currently practiced, this was not always the
                case, nor do all practitioners understand it to
                be an essential element.<br />
                <br />
                From its initial stages to its present-day usage, 
                hypnosis in the West has undergone a series
                of identifiable transformations in its development.
                These transformations reveal the
                relationship between hypnosis and trance, the
                role that imagination plays in the therapeutic
                process, and some key intrinsic aspects of hypnosis
                that pertain to its relationship with
                shamanism. In the West, hypnosis, or mesmerism,
                as it was once called, can be directly
                traced to Anton Mesmer, who in 1776 promoted
                the idea that a general magnetic fluid
                pervaded all of nature, including living organisms,
                and that disease resulted when this magnetic
                fluid was unevenly distributed within the
                body. The proximity of a magnetized substance
                was employed to reestablish the flow of<br />
                magnetic fluid in the body and therefore restore
                the organism to health. Although the<br />
                hypnotic procedure took place without a formal
                trance induction process, healing was accomplished
                by the successful manipulation of
                the patient&rsquo;s expectation of the effects of imagined
                magnetic forces. So powerful were the images
                of the effects of these illusory forces, that
                these therapeutic interventions were often accompanied 
                by violent convulsions on the part
                of the patient.</p>
              <p>The second phase in the development of
                hypnosis centered on the techniques promoted
                by a disciple of Mesmer, the Marquis de Puysegur.
                Puysegur insisted that the healing power
                to realign the magnetic fluids in the patient&rsquo;s
                body resided not in the magnets themselves,
                but rather in the magnetizer, who by mere
                willpower redirected the magnetic flow and
                promoted healing. Puysegur was the first hypnotist
                known to induce a trance in his patients,
                a state that he referred to as somnambulism.
                Thus, this phase in the development of
                hypnosis is distinguished by the use of (still
                imaginary) directed forces, combined with the
                introduction of the somnambulist, or the patient<br />
                in a trance state. Puysegur&rsquo;s techniques
                inspired several healing methods involving hand passes (so-called laying on of the hands)
                and light touching in key areas of the body.<br />
                The next stage in the evolution of hypnosis
                began in 1819 with Abb&eacute; Faria, who developed
                the fixed-gaze method, in which he required
                subjects to fix their attention on an object in
                order to induce trance, after which he would
                offer healing suggestions to complete the intervention.
                Faria believed that the capacity for
                healing resided, not in the magnetizer&rsquo;s powers,
                but rather in the patient&rsquo;s trance state. Despite
                the publication of his results, his discoveries
                sparked little attention and remained unknown
                for some time.<br />
                In 1849, several decades later, and independently
                of Faria&rsquo;s findings, Dr. James Braid also
                discovered that when patients experienced a
                period of focused attention on a light, they became
                more suggestible. He coined the term hypnosis
                to refer to the sleeplike state patients entered
                when they stared at the light for extended
                periods. As with Abb&eacute; Faria, Braid&rsquo;s discovery
                that patients became more susceptible to the
                images elicited by his suggestions when in hypnosis
                than otherwise led him to conclude that
                the therapeutic process depended, not on the effect
                of any magnetic substance, but rather on
                the hypnotic state of the patient. Furthermore,
                Braid concluded that patients&rsquo; suggestibility was
                measured by their capacity to enter the hypnotic
                state. With the advances of both Abb&eacute;
                Faria and James Braid, hypnosis passed into
                what has been called the trance stage, during
                which trance alone, without the manipulation
                of imagined magnetic forces, became understood
                as the basis for the healing intervention.<br />
                <br />
                By the end of the nineteenth century, Hippolyte
                Bernheim and Auguste-Ambroise<br />
                Liebault in France had fully determined that
                hypnosis is the result of psychological forces
                within the subject and not physical or any
                other kind of forces existing outside the subject.
                In 1958, after a two-year study, the American 
                Medical Association accepted hypnosis as a
                viable clinical procedure. Currently, the term
                hypnosis has become exceedingly controversial,
                difficult to define and therefore to delimit. It is
                still often applied indiscriminately to the
                method of intervention called hypnotherapy,
                the hypnotic trance state, and the psychological
                and cognitive phenomena commonly elicited
                during trance, as well as to the means of inducing
                the trance state itself.</p>
              <p>What is important to note about hypnosis
                and can clearly be seen in its history is the central
                role that the individual&rsquo;s imagination, in
                the form of beliefs, suggested images, and expectations,
                plays in the hypnotic encounter,
                with or without the use of trance. In 1784, for
                example, at the request of the king of France,
                Benjamin Franklin led a commission to investigate
                the scientific validity of Mesmer&rsquo;s magnetic
                claims. The result of the royal commissions&rsquo;
                findings were that &ldquo;imagination without magnetism<br />
                produces convulsions, and that magnetism
                without imagination produces nothing&rdquo;<br />
                (cited in Bowers 1976, 8). Nevertheless, trance
                currently plays a central role in hypnotherapy,
                as in this state the suggestions of the hypnotist
                are thought to have magnified effects compared
                to those that similar manipulations would accomplish<br />
                in a &ldquo;normal,&rdquo; or &ldquo;waking,&rdquo; state of
                consciousness. In any case, the patient&rsquo;s expectation,
                which is a cognitive-affective state resulting
                from the combination of the imagined
                outcome of an event or procedure together
                with anticipation associated with that imagining,
                is at work not only within the hypnotic
                trance, but also in each aspect of any given
                therapeutic encounter. This is the case even
                prior to the formal intervention procedure. The
                psychophysiological effect of the impact of
                imagination plus anticipation is an ordinary occurrence
                in the history of medicine and is commonly<br />
                reflected in the phenomenon often derisively
                referred to as the placebo effect (e.g.,<br />
                Bierman 1995; Overton 1998). The placebo effect
                can be defined as the beneficial physiological
                or psychological response that occurs as a
                result of the patient&rsquo;s expectation alone, despite
                the ingestion of an inert substance or the use of
                an intervention that could be expected to have
                no effect. The placebo effect is the bane of the
                pharmacological industry, its power being so
                pervasive that every new drug or treatment
                must demonstrate that its efficacy is greater
                than that of a placebo (Harrington 1997). Furthermore,                &ldquo;its effectiveness has been attested to,
                without exception, for more than two millennia&rdquo;
                (Shapiro and Shapiro 1997, 1).Hypnosis<br />
                exemplifies the psychophysiological power of
                the human imagination, arguably the same
                power also at work during the placebo effect.
                Indeed, for Steve Bierman, the placebo effect is                &ldquo;the cardinal fact&rdquo; of hypnosis (Bierman 1995,
                67). The relationship between the placebo effect and hypnosis is most evident during the
                earliest stages of the history of hypnosis, when
                it relied exclusively on the magnetizer&rsquo;s manipulation<br />
                of the patient&rsquo;s expectation.<br />
                <br />
                The counterpart of a placebo is often referred
                to as a nocebo, that is, an inert substance
                or otherwise nonfunctional intervention that
                produces negative physiological responses based
                on the patient&rsquo;s fatalistic expectations. &ldquo;Voodoo<br />
                death,&rdquo; in which the witch doctor or other
                shamanistic figure&rsquo;s curse leads to the demise of
                the victim, is often presented as the classic example
                of the nocebo effect. The first scientific
                investigation of Voodoo death was undertaken
                by the physiologist Walter Cannon (1942),
                who described this shamanistic phenomenon as
                the &ldquo;fatal power of the imagination working
                through unmitigated terror&rdquo; (cited in Benson<br />
                1996, 41). Thus, the relationship between
                Voodoo death and hypnosis is easy to discern:                &ldquo;Voodoo death is hypnodeath&rdquo; (Overton 1998,
                159). Whether positive (placebo) or negative
                (nocebo), the imagined outcome of the patient&rsquo;s
                expectation can often be so compelling
                to the individual&rsquo;s physiology that the resulting
                imagining becomes, to a lesser or greater extent,
                enacted in the form of healing or ailment.<br />
                <br />
                From the perspective of clinical hypnosis
                Bierman emphasized that placebo, that is, hypnosis
                without trance, and trancework indeed
                represent opposite ends of the &ldquo;technique spectrum&rdquo;
                (Bierman 1995, 67). It is also here where
                we can clearly find one of the common denominators
                between shamanic healing and hypnosis.
                In the shamanic healing encounter, the patient&rsquo;s
                imagination is excited and exercised<br />
                while observing the actions, in the form of
                physical behaviors and verbal descriptions of
                the shaman who, in trance, is mentally traveling
                in the supernatural realm. The reason for
                the &ldquo;shamanic journey&rdquo; or &ldquo;ecstatic flight&rdquo; in
                shamanic traditions lies in the etiology of disease
                in the shamanic paradigm, according to
                which pathology is often attributed to supernatural
                causes in the form of illicit interference,
                such as soul loss, witchcraft, or sorcery. Thus,
                the shaman must ecstatically, that is, in the
                form of an out-of-the-body experience, enter
                the supernatural realm to either obtain the
                knowledge to heal or to intervene in that dimension
                on behalf on the patient.<br />
                <br />
                The role reversal between hypnosis and
                shamanism in the use of trance is an interesting one. For the hypnotherapist, the patient&rsquo;s
                trance magnifies the therapeutic effect of the
                mental images elicited by the hypnotherapist&rsquo;s
                words. For the shaman, the vividness of the experiences
                he describes when journeying plays
                powerfully on the patient&rsquo;s imagination, heavily
                conditioned by culturally acquired expectations.
                In hypnotherapy, following the development
                of the Western model, the ability of the<br />
                healer to heal resides in the mind of the patient,
                because disease is understood to originate
                within an individual. For this reason, it is
                there, in the patient&rsquo;s mental realm, that the
                healer must endeavor to find a solution to the
                malady. Ultimately, both shamanic healing and
                hypnotherapy rely on the power of the human
                imagination to both create vivid and dynamic
                images, and to respond to such imagery, psychologically
                and physiologically, often in dramatic
                and enduring ways (Overton 1998).<br />
                <br />
                Aside from the essential role that imagination
                plays in both shamanism and hypnosis,<br />
                another area in which they are similar is in the
                nature of the trance experience itself. From a
                neurophysiological standpoint, the pattern of
                brain wave activity created during a hypnotic
                trance experience is practically identical to that
                created during similar recording of shamanic
                journeys. In addition, the phenomenology of
                the shamanic journey can readily be replicated
                in any suggestible subject during hypnotic
                trance (Overton 1998, 2000). Consequently, it
                is reasonable to assume that both the shamanic<br />
                journey and the hypnotic trance correspond to
                the same state of the mind-brain and are simply
                social and cultural adaptations of the same psychobiological
                phenomena. As the author concluded,
                where shamanic healing and clinical
                hypnotherapy principally differ &ldquo;is in the fact
                that they are each cultural adaptations fundamentally<br />
                rooted in opposing epistemological
                polarities&rdquo; (Overton 1998, 167). In other
                words, for &ldquo;the Westerner, knowledge resides in
                this reality, thus so should the clinician&rsquo;s consciousness,&rdquo;
                on the other hand, &ldquo;for a member
                of a shamanic culture, knowledge resides in
                non-ordinary reality, and so should the
                shaman&rsquo;s spirit&rdquo; (Overton 1998, 167). Inherent
                to both healing methodologies is the fundamental
                use of the patient&rsquo;s imagination in order
                to achieve the desired responses, be they psychological,<br />
                or physiological, or both.</p>
