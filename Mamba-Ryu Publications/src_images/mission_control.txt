Mission Control
* * * * * * * * * * *
Finaling plan:
1. Titulos
    - update each book with new description - choose either a review or an excerpt - up to you.
    - note which ones still need content (also check which books don't have them on their page yet - 
      will want to get at El Circulo for content
2. PDF sample files for each book
3. Links
    - add based on respones from El Circulo
5. DONE!


??? for El Circulo
1. all blogs / other sites including public facebook groups so
   can put all of them on the "links" page
2. need new reviews and descriptions for some books, but when??    
3. how does it look in general?



1. try a non-scrolling bg - how looks?

1. Add symbolism - why the snake, why the snakeskin bg?
2. home page text - book descriptions need to be better?

1. After HR, maybe a description of what MAMBA Ryu is, and what
   the Press is?
2. More something - home page needs more something.  But what?
3. Consider adding tooltips for comment text:
   - http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2012/11/how-to-create-a-simple-css3-tooltip/
   - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17391194/tooltip-with-html-content-without-javascript
   
   
1. Masters of the Art of Mind-Body in Action
   MAMBA-Ryu Publications intend to disseminate knowledge about
   the... (cop from Maestros Kaizen)
2. Change font on the title text (see what appears in the books)
   Provide 2nd, 3rd fallback font options - ultimate fallback
   is current font.
   Maybe try a png?  Hard to get anti-aliasing right though, no?
3. Input descriptions for each book
4. Ask Pops for help w/ descriptions and acclaim
5. Add 'About MAMBA-Ryu' main link

/*
1. chop images for each page, 400 wide front cover and back cover
2. use the front cover, sized to 300 wide to advantage browser caching
3. make a grid for the "titles" page
4. make each of the individual pages, populate with front cover at
   top left, add placeholder text ("If"), and populate with back cover at
   lower right.  Ping Gustavo-Sempai for crtical acclaim content!
5. Remove "links" for now
6. About the Author - link out to Amazon page for now
7. Sobre MAMBA Ryu - use o old site, perchance, to get something out
   there.  Will need to talk to Pops or Gustavo about how relevant
   that content still is.
8. DONE!
