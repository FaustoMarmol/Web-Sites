	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>
	In many states of the US as well as in Australia certain professionals are required by law to report any abuse they witness carried out upon the defenseless members of their society. I write this book in response to a higher law, a moral law, which compels me to report on the abuses of America and Anglo-American hatred and injustice on the defenseless people within and without its borders who are and have been the victims of said hatred and injustice. This book is therefore a “Mandated Report” for my grandchildren and for my two youngest children, Alexander Jesse Overton and Julia Rachel Overton, both of whom for the initial period of their lives were an integral part of mine and I of theirs and whom, due to the perfidy of their mother and the iniquity of a system which empowered her, have been denied the most fundamental and basic right any person should have in a free society: the right to be who they are. To them I say, “A father never forgets”. To the system, the American system of injustice responsible for not only the breakup of my family, the rape of my son, the innumerable potential and indubitable psychological future damage to my children occasioned by the loss of identity and fatherlessness, but also to the historical and social patterns of crimes against humanity which my ancestors have been subject to for generations and that have become the dominant pattern in its culture, I cite for you Hosea 8:7, “they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it hath no stalk: the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield, the foreigners shall swallow it up.” America has a choice – either it comes to terms with the racist tumor it has so jealously secured and hatefully fostered, or it will be destroyed from within. I leave you two other quotes:
	<br><br>
(1) “America will never be destroyed from the outside. If we falter and lose our freedoms, it will be because we destroyed ourselves” – Abraham Lincoln. The first and foremost of such freedoms, which was lost the moment the first human was shackled and enslaved and when the first Native American was dispossessed of his land, is justice.
<br>
(2) "The day that the black man takes an uncompromising step and realizes that he's within his rights, when his own freedom is being jeopardized, to use any means necessary to bring about his freedom or put a halt to that injustice, I don't think he'll be by himself" – Malcolm X. There can be no freedom without justice, and since I have received none other than injustice throughout my case I have been denied my freedom. Therefore, this book about the story of American injustice is written precisely by such a Black man taking “an uncompromising step” and willing to “use any means necessary to bring about his freedom or put a halt to that injustice”.

	<h3>Chapter 1: "The Fittest Characters to Expound the Law, and Dispense Justice"</h3>
	<p>
	The concept of a “social contract” is critical to the legitimacy of any government and its courts. It determines the degree and nature of the force any government may morally exercise over the people within its designated territorial boundaries or sphere of influence. While the concept of a social contract that binds rulers to those under its control is indeed a much older one; the term itself dates to a work entitled Of The Social Contract, Or Principles of Political Right (Du contrat social ou Principes du droit politique) written in 1762 by Jean-Jacques Rousseau. In a nutshell, as I have often summarized and interpreted for my students, the essence of “social contract theory” is that in society an individual gives up a certain degree of his freedom in exchange for the guaranteed benefits of social living. In other words, we submit to the laws of government in exchange for the protections and vantages said government guarantees us. Should the government fail to deliver its side of the contract, so then expires its moral recourse to curtail our freedom, to impose its laws upon us, and to apply its punishments through its courts when we fail to comply with said laws. [FA1] In other words: a society that does not provide the opportunity for gainful and legal employment has no moral authority to punish those driven by hunger who seek illegal means to feed themselves. Clearly, in order to operate within the might of right the government has obligations to its citizens and residents; when it fails to live up to these obligations it loses moral legitimacy. Its rule is therefore no longer the might of right, but rather the right of might – it has transgressed [FA2] the boundaries of legitimate government into tyranny.

	<h3>Chapter 2: "I Am What I Am Because of Who We All Are"</h3>
	<p>
	Africa is the birthplace of our species. It is no wonder therefore that the most complete view of what is means to be human would also arise from within the African continent. The African cultural tradition of ubuntu as it is called in the Bantu language is known for its systems view of the human being.[FA1]  An integral part of the MAMBA (Mastering the Art of Mind-Body in Action) paradigm of my own creation, ubuntu is a social and moral philosophy which integrates the ethical principles of the “golden rule” (“Do unto others as you would have them do onto you”) of Judaism as well as the “platinum rule” (“Do not do unto others as you would not have done unto you”) of Confucianism, while simultaneously predating both those teachings, in all likelihood, by hundreds if not thousands of years.

	The Truth must be told. This is a “Mandated Report” – a Truth-Telling report about America mandated by my own conscience. My son’s voice will be heard and my children’s story will be told because I their father was there to listen. Thanks to the Family Court system, however, I am no longer allowed to be a father – but I will tell you how that happened and why. “Mandated Report” is my “Truth-Telling” story, the “Truth-Telling” story of my children, and the “Truth-Telling” story of my People in America, and it will be told.

"The battle, Sir, is not to the strong alone; it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave. Besides, Sir, we have no election. If we were base enough to desire it, it is now too late to retire from the contest. There is no retreat but in submission and slavery! Our chains are forged! Their clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston! The war is inevitable; and let it come! I repeat, Sir, let it come!" -- Patrick Henry

	<h3>Chapter 3: "The Black Raccoon"</h3>
	<p>
	The State, however, will now begin to experience something entirely new from me. The State is now my Private Enemy Number One and I shall wage war upon it the manner I have been trained to; not with bullets or bombs, but rather in a much more devastating and effective manner: with facts and ideas, with arguments and words, and most importantly, with the truth. My mind is my implement of battle, and the truth will not set the State or its representatives free.
	</p>
	<br>

	<h3>Chapter 4: "To be or not to be 'Black' - that is the Question"</h3>
	<p>
	Nothing is more important to the establishment of the Pursuit of Happiness within a State than justice. Nothing defines the quality and the integrity of a State more so than justice; nothing exemplifies best its commitment to the social contract more than so than justice does. Standard of living does not, nor does medical care, nor does technological advancement; security does not, nor does law and order – for fascist dictatorships can deliver those of the former, but justice and only justice is the sine qua non of freedom. Those of you even remotely familiar with Christian theology and ethics will recognize St. Augustine as one of the founders not only of Catholic dogma but also of Western moral doctrine. His statement, "an unjust law is no law at all" has provided the moral basis for civil disobedience movements around the world. There is a just ring to it; there is a truth to it. It feels right, it makes sense. Law and order are but tyranny without just laws and their just dispensation. Consider the full quote from the City of God cited briefly above:
 <br><br>
Justice being taken away, then, what are kingdoms but great robberies? For what are robberies themselves, but little kingdoms? The band itself is made up of men; it is ruled by the authority of a prince, it is knit together by the pact of the confederacy; the booty is divided by the law agreed on. If, by the admittance of abandoned men, this evil increases to such a degree that it holds places, fixes abodes, takes possession of cities, and subdues peoples, it assumes the more plainly the name of a kingdom, because the reality is now manifestly conferred on it, not by the removal of covetousness, but by the addition of impunity. Indeed, that was an apt and true reply which was given to Alexander the Great by a pirate who had been seized. For when that king had asked the man what he meant by keeping hostile possession of the sea, he answered with bold pride, “What thou meanest by seizing the whole earth; but because I do it with a petty ship, I am called a robber, whilst thou who dost it with a great fleet art styled emperor.”

	<h3>Chapter 5: "I Stand Before You..."</h3>
	<p>
	Even those of you who know little or next to nothing about United States modern history remember Martin Luther King, Jr. and the struggle for African American Civil Rights in America. You may be of the ignorant many who believe that racism is a thing of the past in the United States given that there is an African American President sitting in the Oval Office of the White House, but you are still aware of the legendary struggle of a People from slavery to freedom and Civil Rights, and from the chains of the auction block to the office of the Presidency. It took a measure of radical extremism in many, many individuals and a willingness to lay down their lives in order to achieve such goals. Hence the meaning behind Martin Luther King, Jr.’s words when he states: “I submit to you that if a man hasn't discovered something that he will die for, he isn't fit to live”.  It means that in order to have meaning in your life there must an ideal more important than your own personal comfort and prosperity for which you are willing to sacrifice even your life.
	<br><br>
John Philpot Curran reminds us that without that willingness to sacrifice, we as a People will lose whatever freedoms we have, falling prey to the power-hungry tyranny of those who would, by the very nature of Government and power of the State, enslave us. Remember Thomas Jefferson’s words: a government should fear its people and not the other way around. 
 <br><br>
Nelson Mandela informs us, through a wealth of personal experience, that freedom must be obtained through struggle – life and death struggle if need be. Without such commitment, Joseph-Marie, comte de Maistre declares, We the People simply have the government we deserve. That point, as a student of history and international politics, is quite clear to me. The question is, fellow Americans, do we have the government we want? And even more importantly, what type of People must we become to deserve such a government?
<br><br> 
The above quotes that open the present chapter all have meaning and relevance in and of themselves. However, more importantly is that in conjunction they all, directly or indirectly, implicitly or explicitly, reflect a common theme: social contract. Nevertheless, for there to be a social contract there must also be a prevailing social conscience within a given society that both State and People share in terms of a common moral ground.

	<h3>Chapter 6: "A Perfect Storm"</h3>
	<p>
	BEHIND ENEMY LINES
	<br>
First of all, before I disclose matters of a more intimate nature regarding my personal history, let me make something crystal clear: I don’t wish. Not only do I not wish, I don’t pray, I don’t hope, I don’t desire, and I sure as Hades don’t beg. I plan, I strategize, I maneuver, I hypothesize, I calculate, I envision, and sometimes, when the wind blows in the right direction, the moon is in the adequate phase, the stars line up in the proper way and I am in the right mood, I foresee, I anticipate, and I predict – but I bloody well don’t wish. Wishing is for children who want something from Santa Claus, from the gods, from the Tooth Fairy, from their Fairy Godmother, or from any other fictional character that their unlimited imagination can conjure up; but it is not for freethinking men or women. Wishing is not for warriors, it’s not for the wise – it is for the weak and the meek. Wishing, hoping, desiring, praying, and the like are for the Slave Minded. The Master Minded do not wish; the Master Minded plan patiently, they persevere implacably, and they accomplish impeccably – or they die in the effort. Regardless, they succeed or they fail according to their own abilities and resources, but they don’t wish upon a star or otherwise rely on supernatural interventions on their behalf.
