The combination of <em>knowledge</em> and <em> behavior</em> that lead to this state is known as <em>wisdom</em>.</p>

From there the student/apprentice begins to                   learn to identify which of his or her own existential schemas,                   attachments and desires, beliefs and attitudes, and patterns and                   behaviors are incompatible with obtaining the goal of<em> eudaimonia - </em>and why.</p>

For this very reason religious and spiritual                   movements arise that attempt to reunite, reintegrate, and                   harmonize the individual with self, circumstances, and the                   universe at large.</p>
