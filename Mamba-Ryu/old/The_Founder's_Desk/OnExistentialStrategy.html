            <td><p>Existential strategy  is a methodology of life, a &lsquo;Way,&rsquo; dedicated to directing an individual toward  liberation, toward a psychological/spiritual state of inner harmony, emotional  equilibrium, personal excellence, clarity and self-power.&nbsp; To begin to understand what existential  strategy consists of we must first arm ourselves with two concepts: strategy  and existentialism.<br />
              &nbsp; <br />
  Historically it was in  the field of war that strategy was first defined and actualized as a discipline;  as a representation of war the martial arts developed with a great emphasis on  the field of strategy and the related concepts of tactics and stratagems.&nbsp; Classical treatises such as <em>The Art of War</em> and <em>The Book of Five Rings</em> for example preserve and invigorate this  knowledge within the field of martial arts.&nbsp;  It is from this influence that the perspective of existential strategy decidedly  adopts a martial warrior attitude.&nbsp; <br />
                The general concept of  strategy as a paradigm applies to many fields in such a way that one hears of <em>economic strategy</em>, <em>political strategy</em>, or <em>legal  strategies</em>.&nbsp; The development of  strategy as an art and as a science, as a methodology of cognition and action,  however, &nbsp;is still in its embryonic  state.&nbsp; Nonetheless we can offer a  functional, operational definition:<br />
                <br />
                  <em><strong>Strategy is the perspicacious administration of  limited resources to reach objectives, overcome adversities, and impose our  designs.&nbsp; </strong></em><br />
                  <br />
                Now what do we mean by <em>existential</em>?&nbsp; As the term indicates, by <em>existential</em> we refer to something that has  to do with life, with existence, with overcoming, with survival.&nbsp; But here <em>existential</em> refers to something more substantial, something deeper, something more  profound.&nbsp; The <em>existential</em> in <em>existential  strategy</em> has to do with the art of bearing the human existential condition,  the type of existence specific to our species.&nbsp;  It is true that every species needs to face the demands of existence, of  eating without being eaten, of procreation.&nbsp;  And these demands are faced not in a vacuum but amidst an ecological  context, amidst an environment: those that adapt pass on their genes, those  that don&rsquo;t populate museums to be seen and admired.&nbsp; It is for this reason that the processes of  adapting to the environment leave their undeniable traces in the form and  behavior of the species - animals and plants alike.&nbsp; <br />
                <br />
                But the evolutionary  processes that transformed genus after genus of hominids until progressing to  our subspecies <em>homo sapiens sapiens</em> did  a lot more than just integrate bipedal locomotion, manual dexterity and a  smooth epidermis into our physical constitution.&nbsp; Evolution, with its various processes of  selective adaptation and random mutation, ultimately transformed our neuronal  networks into the functional basis of our brain matter &ndash; what resulted was a  mind with something truly unique, unseen, and intrinsically human:  imagination.&nbsp; <br />
                <br />
                Imagination, that  capacity to create mental experiences even more realistic than those  originating from perception itself is the faculty of going beyond what our  senses present.&nbsp; Imagination is the capacity  to create images and experiences (some mundane, others fantastic) that  transport us away from the <em>here and now</em> of the physical and temporal present to defy the repressive laws of time and space  and place us in the <em>there and then</em>.&nbsp; Imagination, that cognitive platform of art, of  language, of technology and of spirituality is what converts us into human  beings, but at the same time removes us, alienates and estranges us from the  rest of nature, from the cosmos, from other human beings and &ndash; worst of all &ndash;  from ourselves.&nbsp; <br />
                <br />
                With imagination we  barely feel the continuous actual present, instead living in an imperfect and  elastic recreation of the past or pre-experiencing an unlimited number of  possible futures.&nbsp; With imagination  thunder and lightning are not mere and imposing meteorological phenomena but rather  an expression of the fury of the gods expressing their discontent with the  tribe.&nbsp; With imagination the shadows of  the campfire in the cave are not just rays of light in the darkness, but rather  the spirits of our ancestors inviting us to the ritual dance of the hunt.&nbsp; With imagination a spoken phrase is not just  a concatenation of incoherent sounds, but rather reference to an object, an  image, an event of the past, future, or present.&nbsp; With imagination a symbol designed on a plane  is no longer a mere scratching but rather a chemical formula for the  manufacture of explosives.&nbsp; <br />
                <br />
                From the standpoint of  adaptation to the environment and overcoming the same, imagination provided our  species with a competitive advantage that allowed it to persist.&nbsp; Lacking the superior physical faculties of  the rest of the animal kingdom &ndash; claws to take down prey or dissuade predators,  wings to navigate the free horizons of the open sky, bronchioles to breathe in  the blue depth of the aqueous abyss, or blinding speed to both hunt or avoid  being hunted &ndash; the survival of our species took place thanks to the adaptation  of our central nervous system, specifically our brain.&nbsp; And which is the function of our brain most  responsible for our survival as a species?&nbsp;  Imagination.<br />
                <br />
                  <strong>Imagination is the undiscovered horizon of the  human essence, and the brain, our evolutionary adaptation to our environment,  is our organ of the same.&nbsp; </strong><br />
                  <br />
                  But every silver  lining has its cloud, and imagination would not be an exception to the  rule.&nbsp; As primates we continue to be  social animals, and as such we house a great emotional complexity that is  absent in solitary or unsociable animals.&nbsp;  It is here, in our emotional and affective super-development, that a great  deal of our imagination becomes a double-edged sword.&nbsp; On the one hand it allows us to depict scenarios  in our mind: plan for future events, analyze past events, and formulate  detailed representations of possible realities and submit them to the process  of group-rationalization by way of rhetoric and dialectic, eventually deciding on  a course of action that involves a minimum of personal risk.&nbsp; But on the other hand it leads us into angst  and sadness, anxiety and depression when we re-evoke the past or live futures  without previous existence, suffering emotionally as if those were actually tangible  realities.&nbsp; Imagination brings with it  the <em>human existential condition</em> to formulate  questions such as &lsquo;where do we come from?&rsquo; and &lsquo;what is beyond death?&rsquo; and &ndash;  most importantly &ndash; imagination brings about the anxiety of not always obtaining  completely satisfactory answers.&nbsp; <br />
                  <br />
                  We live in a  particular socio-historical time, one which sociologists and other academics  have referred to as &lsquo;post-modernism.&rsquo;&nbsp; As  an era, post-modernism is characterized by a crisis of values, of absolutes, of  beliefs, of ideologies that are fixed &ndash; determined by an existential  crisis.&nbsp; Where does this crisis come  from?&nbsp; On the one hand we are experiencing  the inevitable result of the clash between science and reason with faith and  religion &ndash; the world is not flat; the Sun does not revolve around the Earth;  the sky opens to a cold abyss of galaxies, constellations, stars, satellites  and planets of which ours is only one amongst the literally innumerable; the  archeological record indicates a planet that developed over billions of years,  not in six days; beings are borne not by spontaneous generation but rather by  the procreation of others that are equal or genetically compatible.&nbsp; <br />
                  <br />
                  The belief in the  existential, transcendental answers that religion offers &ndash; any religion &ndash; become  more and more difficult for us to accept, and every day we find a greater  number of individuals that &lsquo;personalize&rsquo; their religion according to their  perspectives and needs, ignoring the dogma imposed by the official authority of  the same.&nbsp; The world is becoming smaller  and in any one of our societies, especially in our western societies, we come  into contact with spiritual ideologies or religions originating in other cultures,  each proposing different premises and conclusions, many of which are  contradictory or incompatible regarding the origin, essence, and destiny of the  cosmos and the human being.&nbsp; For the Jew,  Christian, and Muslim, time follows a linear pattern &ndash; the universe itself  began at one point in time and it will end at another.&nbsp; For the Hindu, to the contrary, time is  cyclical, and creation and destruction of everything that exists repeats, and  shall repeat itself innumerable times.&nbsp;  For the Hindu the soul, the <em>atman</em>,  the immutable essence of every being, reincarnates until it reaches a  development such that it is free from the cycle.&nbsp; Instead the Buddhist believes in <em>anatma </em>&ndash; that this immutable essence  does not exist, that everything is in flux.&nbsp; <br />
                  <br />
                  The essential and  inalienable incompatibilities between the spiritual traditions of this world  leave us in a state of insecurity &ndash; where does the truth, the absolute truth lie  that we so desire?&nbsp; Many, fed up with the  anguish and disappointed by the search, try to escape, finding a temporary &lsquo;fix&rsquo;  in self-annihilation by way of legal or illegal narcotics, or at the hands of those  stupefying distractions known as consumer electronics. <br /> 
                  <br />
                  The human being, plagued  with the human existential condition worse than ever in the postmodern era, begets  necessities that are unique amongst the living beings of this planet.&nbsp; The objective of existential strategy is  precisely to search that individual level &ndash; &lsquo;what are those needs?&rsquo; and &lsquo;how do  we meet them?&rsquo;&nbsp; The resources may be limited  but the objectives are clear and attainable: live our lives, our existence,  whatever it may be, with a minimum  of interior harmony, with personal peace, with spiritual tranquility, with a  sensation of excellence and accomplishment.&nbsp;  We seek quarter in battle, quietude in chaos, certainty in  confusion.&nbsp; As a methodology of life <strong><em>Existential  Strategy</em></strong>, also known as the <strong><em>Tao of Mamba-Ryu</em></strong>, makes use of numerous and varied disciplines  and areas of knowledge to obtain its objectives: the psychology of religion,  martial arts and other strategic disciplines, hypo-shamanism, Mamba Mindfulness,  the cognitive sciences, clinical and health psychology, western philosophies of  mind and existentialism, and the oriental philosophies of Buddhism, Taoism and  Zen.&nbsp; Guided by our motto &ldquo;from knowledge  to wisdom&rdquo; we make use of many teaching methods such as the &ldquo;Socratic workshop,&rdquo;  group work, brief lessons and clarifying teachings to guide our students and  apprentices to stimulate self-questioning and the development of their own  comprehension and intuition.&nbsp; <br />
                  <br />
                  <strong><em>Existential strategy</em></strong> brings together interdisciplinary knowledge  with the goal of transcending academic perspectives and reaching both a  pragmatic disposition and singular wisdom, transforming theoretical knowledge  into a practical mission of vital actions that lead to that personal happiness  that only arises from the integration of mental, physical, and spiritual  well-being.&nbsp; </p>
