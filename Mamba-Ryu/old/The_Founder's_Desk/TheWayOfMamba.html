          <tr>
            <td><p>Throughout my early childhood and   						into my middle adolescence my greatest concerns, my   						ultimate preoccupations focused on overcoming the abject   						terror and violence that at times defined my existence.   						Early on in life I realized that the solution to that   						problem did not reside solely in physical conditioning,   						technical preparation, or cognitive speculation, for in   						the face of life-threatening peril if we are without a   						resilient mental constitution such attributes can   						quickly uproot and leave us stranded in helplessness and   						despair.</p>
              <p>I believe that it was as a result   						of those early impacting experiences that my interest in   						the martial arts and other Eastern practices and   						methodologies was focused more on the mental capacities   						that lead to enduring tranquility in the face of   						disaster than on the mere physical manifestations of   						power or technique. It was not nearly as much the   						fighting prowess of &ldquo;Kwai Chang Caine&rdquo; from the   						syndicated television series &ldquo;Kung Fu&rdquo; that captured my   						imagination as the wisdom and serenity of the Shaolin   						masters who trained him. It was not nearly as much the   						cinematographically dazzling dynamics and cries of the   						likes of Bruce Lee that inspired me, as the television   						images of the Buddhist monk who protesting religious   						injustice in South Vietnam self-immolated and died   						immutable, motionless and silent.</p>
              <p>Over the years it became evident   						to me it is only with a strong psychological,   						philosophical and even &lsquo;spiritual&rsquo; foundation that the   						edifice of our existence can be counted upon to weather   						the storms of life&rsquo;s adversities, disappointments and   						disasters; it is also such a foundation that enables us   						to appreciate the magnificence and wonder of &lsquo;being&rsquo; -   						no matter how objectionable the load we carry, how heavy   						the rock we must roll.</p>
              <p>It is not in the moments of   						fashionable victory that we find the real champion; it   						is not in the hours, weeks, or years of celebrated   						discoveries or renowned achievements that we discover   						authentic &lsquo;greatness&rsquo;; it is in those inexorable   						instances lived by individuals who time and time again,   						whether faced with innumerable failures and tragic   						disappointments, threatened with dying in total   						anonymity, or living in abject poverty, demonstrate   						their unrelenting rededication to the &lsquo;cause&rsquo;.</p>
              <p>Show me a man or woman whom, after   						being repeatedly beaten down and even broken by the   						implacable and unremitting forces of a reality beyond   						their control, and whom without seeking refuge either in   						fantastic dimensions or in fictional beings, stands up   						yet again on their own accord, in spirit if not in   						shattered body, and I will show you the true meaning of   						inner fortitude and personal power. Find an individual   						who even in the thick of life&rsquo;s sometimes unpredictable   						trials and tribulations, cruel losses, untimely   						setbacks, and heartbreaking tragedies derives &lsquo;meaning&rsquo;   						from the mere fact of being alive, and you would have   						found someone who has mastered the elusive art of being   						happy.</p>
              <p>It is not the person whom, if   						afforded the luxury of calm and comfort can achieve a   						state of &lsquo;mystical awareness&rsquo; that we need admire.   						Rather it is the individual who, when faced with the   						unpredictable disasters of the life truly engaged and is   						caught in the wicked clasp of circumstance, manages   						to rapidly recover their composure and demonstrate   						&lsquo;centeredness&rsquo; that we need seek out, for these people   						have obtained something beyond what books can teach or   						techniques alone can foster: wisdom.</p>
              <p>Wisdom, the combined knowledge and   						practice of that which leads to happiness and harmony in   						one&rsquo;s life in spite of circumstances is what we are all   						ultimately after. Personal power alone is not sufficient,   						for without the mental mechanisms to guide its   						potential, without the philosophical/spiritual context   						within which to apply its resources we are but a   						Titanic: unstoppable in our motion and condemned to meet   						our demise at the inevitable encounter with life&rsquo;s   						innumerable and unforgiving icebergs.</p>
              <p>The human existential condition is   						by its nature fraught with inevitable loss &ndash; or its   						threat: loss of life, loss of health, loss of youth,   						loss of property and possessions, loss of loved ones,   						loss of innocence, and so on, and therefore becomes   						tainted by the accompanying grief and anguish that   						naturally ensues. But it is in the chaos of war that we   						encounter all of life&rsquo;s most deplorable aspects in their   						extreme: carnage and mutilation, devastation and   						dispossession, pillaging and desecration, famine and   						disease, etc.</p>
              <p>It is not surprising that many   						individuals return from the battlefield mentally   						traumatized and emotionally defiled and disturbed,   						unable to successfully reintegrate themselves into the   						&lsquo;normality&rsquo; of their previous peacetime existence. Nor   						is it surprising that elite warrior castes would have   						sought philosophical/spiritual methodologies, such as   						was the case with the Samurai and Zen, in order to   						develop the mental and emotional capacity to endure the   						vileness of warfare and inwardly reconcile the   						gruesomeness of their experiences within the context of   						a way of life and <em>being</em>.</p>
              <p>It is for this reason that to me   						the <em>real</em> martial arts aim to teach more than just   						techniques of physical power; they must seek to set the   						practitioner on a path to the self-empowerment,   						discovery and improvement that leads beyond an   						accumulation of information or the memorization of   						movements, a path which leads to the immutable spirit   						that derives from mind and body coordinated in   						harmonious action. This is the Way of MAMBA.</p>
