          <tr>
            <td><p>I believe there is but one  Truth: <br />
That in time and space we  trace a path <br />
From birth to inevitable oblivion <br />
And that over that dominion <br />
No  gods born to man have say&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
I believe that Heaven or Hell  is other people.</p>
                    <p>I believe that to live is to  struggle, <br />
                      To stand only to fall again, <br />
                      Sometimes to yield and at others  to contend, <br />
                      Yet always to battle against that  bitter end, <br />
                      And then, <br />
                      As that final moment takes  its course, <br />
                      To curse or to endorse a lifetime's  passing.</p>
                    <p>I believe in honesty and  integrity, <br />
                      Yet in wisdom before fact or  truth <br />
                      And that much of one's youth  is spent <br />
                      In search of such distinctions.</p>
                    <p>I believe that humankind is cursed  by immortal addictions<br />
                      And that no greater folly <br />
                      Created further afflictions  in this world</p>
                    <p>I believe that white men can  jump. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
                      I believe in family <br />
                      And in the value of a true  friend, <br />
                      And in loyalty and in just  retribution, <br />
                      For in that fair distribution  of acts there is no crime. </p>
                    <p>I believe that friends are  those who win when you win <br />
                      And share in your losses and  defeats.</p>
                    <p>I believe that &lsquo;spirit&rsquo; is  the metal forged <br />
                      When mind and body join to challenge  the fires of adversity</p>
                    <p>I believe in character and in  presence<br />
                      And that the essence of a man  or woman,<br />
                      Can only be found as when balancing  at the edge of the abyss<br />
                      And through each narrow miss of  steps misplaced<br />
                      We establish who we really  are</p>
                    <p>I believe that I must avoid  before I injure, <br />
                      Injure before I maim, <br />
                      Maim before I kill, <br />
                      But if the challenge carries  me further still, <br />
                      Then slay I must and will, <br />
                      To save family, self or  friend</p>
                    <p>I believe that the greatest transgressions<br />
                      Have been committed by those  armed with fictitious creeds <br />
                      Uttered by confabulated  beings <br />
                      Responsible for fabricated  deeds</p>
                    <p>I believe that love is the one  reliable palliative<br />
                      Against the benign  indifference of the Universe</p>
                    <p>I believe that humankind&rsquo;s  capacity for illusion<br />
                      Renders more often than not<br />
                      A self-defeating delusion<br />
                      That ensnares and entraps  with impalpable bonds</p>
                    <p>I believe that against the  vice of requesting <br />
                      Is the virtue of not  providing</p>
                    <p>I believe that if you run  from reality or yourself, <br />
                      You&rsquo;ll only get tired, <br />
                      But that most become mired  precisely in that flight</p>
                    <p>I believe that the actions  that mark one's life <br />
                      Should be painted in bold and  broad strokes</p>
                    <p>I believe that Faith means not  wanting to know what is true</p>
                    <p>I believe that the genocide of  a nation<br />
                      Continues with the  eradication of another&rsquo;s past, <br />
                      Deprecation of its present, <br />
                      And the implantation of alien  idols <br />
                      In the image and semblance of  its oppressors</p>
                    <p>I believe that animals have  minds</p>
                    <p>I believe that the best a man  can be <br />
                      Is a father to those in need<br />
                      And by deed a brother to his  fellow being</p>
                    <p>I believe that patience is a  virtue, <br />
                      But only while waiting, <br />
                      And that in hating there is  no reward</p>
                    <p>I believe that vision is the  best defense <br />
                      Against life's insurmountable  odds, <br />
                      And it is in its enactment  that we become <br />
                      Like the very gods we have  created</p>
                    <p>I believe that to know and  not to do is not to know</p>
                    <p>I believe that greatness is  born only of life's school of war; <br />
                      And that life, or death, <br />
                      Are individual choices that  each and every one us have the right to bear</p>
                    <p>I believe that each of us is  born a piece of metal or a rock, <br />
                      Or perhaps a wooden block, <br />
                      And against life's jabs and  gashes, <br />
                      We must add our own slashes  of the chisel <br />
                      And make ourselves into works  of art</p>
                    <p>I believe that poverty is the  only original sin</p>
                    <p>I believe in the power of the  will, <br />
                      And the will to power, <br />
                      And that where there is a  will there is most often a way, <br />
                      And that the way of the will  together with the skill to survive, <br />
                      Will keep the dreams alive, <br />
                      Dreams that shed light into  the darkness of the day-mare</p>
                    <p>I believe that virtue is  found <br />
                      In that ineffable and sacred  space <br />
                      Between being and becoming</p>
                    <p>I believe in demanding  perfection, <br />
                      But settling for excellence</p>
                    <p>I believe that truth is a  scarce resource<br />
                      And that it should be  employed judiciously</p>
                    <p>I believe in nurture over  nature, <br />
                      And that our society is  guilty of neglect <br />
                      When it condemns the young of  mind <br />
                      To the cells of institutions <br />
                      Rather than training them to  make their own contributions <br />
                      To the whole</p>
                    <p>I believe that the purpose of  education<br />
                      Is to learn to separate fact  from fiction <br />
                      In the pursuit of the  inalienable essentials of human existence</p>
                    <p>I believe that friends  forget, <br />
                      Family dies, and possessions  lose their shine, <br />
                      But only greatness knows  forever -<br />
                      For those capable of  achieving it </p>
                    <p>I believe that the days pass  and lose the brightness of their glory, <br />
                      And in the end all that  remains are the quiet whispers of one&rsquo;s own life story</p>
                    <p>I believe that to be free is  to be given the choice to become or to simply not to be</p>
                    <p>I believe that each moment  should be lived <br />
                      And experienced as if its  actions echoed an eternity</p>
                    <p>I believe that in life the  pursuit of certainty<br />
                      Ends only in death,<br />
                      And that this is the one forgotten  Truth, <br />
                      Corrupted by centuries of misinterpretations. </p>
