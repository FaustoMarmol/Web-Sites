        <td><p> <strong> <em class="gold_text">BLACK MAMBA</em>&nbsp; </strong> is the direct result of the   				experiences, research, and training programs of its founder   				James Alexander Guerra Overton. The son of an Afro-Indian   				American father and a Spanish mother, Master/Founder Overton was   				born in the United States in 1963, in a decade of intense racial   				turmoil and only shortly after many states had overturned their   				&quot;Jim Crow&quot; laws forbidding mixed racial marriages. From his   				earliest infancy he experienced extreme racial violence   				resulting in physical attacks which on more than one occasion   				left him unconscious and abandoned for dead. The effects of   				these encounters affected his physical and emotional health   				causing serious digestive disorders, migraines, allergies, and   				general respiratory problems. At 7 years of age and after having   				sustained emergency-room treatments for asthma attacks,   				Overton's allergist assured him that without a disciplined   				exercise regimen to strengthen his lungs he would most likely   				not live to see his 12th birthday.</p>
          <p>Largely in response to this   				social reality which threatened to end the life of their (at the   				time) only son, the Overtons left the United States for the   							mother's homeland, Spain. It was there at 8 years of   							age when Overton commenced his training in yoga and   							Zen.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, violence would not   							elude him for long. Responding to a period of   							political instability in Spain after the   							assassination of the Prime Minister, Admiral Carrero Blanco, at the age of 10 the   				family moved to England for slightly over a year, where the   				young Overton would once again be exposed to the physical and   				emotional trauma of racial violence. Upon returning to Spain at the   				age of 12 years and as a result of a passing encounter with a   				member of the local youth gang, Overton would find himself   				involved in a series of events and experiences that lasted years   				and forever affected his perspective on the martial arts in all   				of its aspects - physical, psychological, and philosophical. It   				is during this period that his passion for the oriental and   				combative disciplines emerges.</p>
          <p>At the age of 18 the Overton   				family would move to Canada, where he would continue to pursue   				his study of the martial arts (karate, judo, aikido, boxing,   				kickboxing, kung-fu, tae-kwon-do, Filipino eskrima, and others),   				training with world-ranked fighters in kickboxing, amateur   				boxing, and tae-kwon-do. He would begin teaching his own art <strong><em>BLACK MAMBA</em> </strong> in 1990 at the age of 27. In 1995 in order to pursue a   				graduate career at UCSD, Overton would move to San Diego,   				California where his study of the martial arts would intensify,   				leading him to obtain teaching ranks and licenses under   				internationally renowned masters and grandmasters in judo,   				Japanese jujutsu, Brazilian jujutsu, aiki-jujutsu, Russian sambo,   				hapkido, combat hapkido, ninjutsu, Thai boxing (Muay Thai), and   				krav maga.</p>
          <p>It is also during   							this time that Overton would become the coach and   							primary training partner to his son Jimmy, who won   							several national and international judo titles as   							well as a place on the Canadian national judo team,   							all for which Master-Founder Overton would be   							awarded the title of Best Coach in Canadian judo for   							three consecutive years (1999, 2000, 2001).</p>
          <p> Combining his martial knowledge with his studies   				in the disciplines of shamanism, psychology, neurosciences,   				cognitive sciences, world religions, oriental and Western   				philosophy, survival, and executive protection, Master-Founder   				Overton would expand <strong> <em>BLACK MAMBA</em></strong> into the broader <strong><em>MAMBA</em></strong>-<strong><em>RYU</em></strong>,   				designating <strong><em>BLACK MAMBA</em></strong> as its physically combative branch.</p>
          <p>In July 2006 Master-Founder Overton was   				inducted into the United States Martial Arts Hall of Fame.</p></td>
