                <em>The  origins of mindfulness as a mental technique, as a series of mental exercises  can be found in Hindu yoga. We are talking about a discipline originating some  thousands of years ago. No one knows exactly when yoga began, therefore no one  knows exactly when mindfulness began, but in the Bhagavad-Gita, a sacred book  of Hinduism dated between 50 and 500 BCE, the teachings of the god Krishna to  his disciple Arjuna on the field of &lsquo;duty&rsquo; at the dawn of a great battle included  a direct reference to this mental technique. The teachings of this god to his  mortal disciple focus on a fundamental principle of mindfulness &ndash; the need to  calm &ldquo;the whirlpools of the mind&rdquo; in order to be able to accomplish the things  one must accomplish despite emotional conflicts such as fear, feelings of  guilt, anxiety etc. As far as I know this is one of the first literary  references to this practice, to this mental discipline, and to the role that it  plays not only relating to individual behavior but to the fulfillment of social  duty itself. Mindfulness is central to the psychology and spiritual philosophy  of Buddhism and of Zen and therefore it passed on to play a central role in the  warrior paradigm of the Asian martial arts. With mindfulness one learns to live <strong>in</strong> the present - but not only <strong>for</strong> the present.</em> </p>
                    <p><strong class="cardinal">What does mindfulness consist of?</strong> <br />
                        <em>Despite  the fact that the English word does not encompass everything of the meaning of  mindfulness, it does give us an indication of what it consists of: mind +  fullness. Mindfulness consists of on the one hand filling the mind, and on the  other hand of being conscious and responsible for the contents of the same.  With mindfulness we learn to focus our attention: focus our attention on being  conscious and focus on what we think of, on what we put into our minds. But  mindfulness goes beyond being conscious or placing one&rsquo;s attention; it also  consists of a certain type of control, of management, of domain over the  conscious mind. Mindfulness seen thusly is a program that consists of learning  how to focus the mind deliberately, of freeing us from the extraneous, of  making a selection of which types of thoughts, emotions, or stimuli we want to  focus on to the exclusion of others, of deciding which are the useless and even  hurtful thoughts and not allowing ourselves to be dominated or carried away by  them. The final objective of mindfulness is the development of control over the  conscious mind through what we could call a &lsquo;super-consciousness,&rsquo; a  &lsquo;meta-consciousness&rsquo; &ndash; an attention to the mechanisms and contents of the mind  in order to control its mechanisms and select its contents. </em> </p>
                    <p><strong class="cardinal">What is  MAMBA-MINDFULNESS?</strong> <br />
                  Mamba  Mindfulness is a much more structured and intense version of mindfulness than  is commonly taught. Due to the fact that it forms part of the martial paradigm  that is Mamba-Ryu, the ultimate objective of mindfulness (the development of a  super-consciousness) is much more of an imperative than in other typical  mindfulness programs. In general these [common] programs consist of a series of  basic exercises &ndash; be they breathing or meditation &ndash; practiced in a very static  and tranquil fashion, removed from the hustle and bustle of everyday  activities; a typical program teaches one to meditate according to the principles  of mindfulness and it ends there. It tells people they have to meditate half an  hour a day and that this will help them with their stress. Some mindfulness  programs are more advanced than others, applying the principles of mindfulness  to the management of mental processes during physical activities such as  walking or eating lunch. However, these programs have little to do with  applying the principles of mindfulness to the real world. Of course meditation  in itself is important &ndash; it gives the mind and the body a refuge, a space in  time where it can take a break from the stresses of life. But Mamba Mindfulness  is much more extensive and intensive, much more dynamic and strategic in its  applications of the principles of super-consciousness. This in great part is  due to the fact that Mamba is a martial paradigm for life in which there is a  distinctive warrior paradigm in operation. For Mamba the acceptance of  adversity as integral or inevitable combines with the self-imposed directive of  maintaining emotional equilibrium and stability; that is to say, for the Mamba  to maintain himself centered is not a desirable option but rather an  obligation, an acceptance of the responsibility that one has within oneself, a  mandate to achieve peace and inner harmony. </p>
                    <p><strong class="cardinal">How does one  develop &lsquo;Super CONSCIOUSNESS&rsquo;?</strong> <br />
                        <em>Although  the details of the training program depend largely on the dedication and  capacities of the student or disciple, one can outline a general program in  three phases: <strong>static</strong>, <strong>dynamic</strong>, and <strong>strategic</strong>.</em> </p>
                    <p><strong><em>The  first phase </em></strong><em>consists of learning how mental processes work at their most rudimentary  level. Here we learn to be aware of our breathing and of its relationship with  our thoughts and emotions. We become conscious of the basic connection between  the body and the mind and we become aware of how difficult it is to calm the  incessant &lsquo;whirlpools of the mind.&rsquo; In this basic phase we learn to meditate,  we learn to breathe, we learn to become aware of what we are inside; in other  words we learn &lsquo;how our mind works.&rsquo; We discover the elemental truth about the  human mind &ndash; that it likes to eschew the present, escape from t<strong>he here and  the now</strong> at all costs and focus on the future, on fantasy, on the past, on  the beyond, <strong>on the &lsquo;there&rsquo; and the &lsquo;then&rsquo;</strong>.</em></p>
                    <p><strong><em>The  second phase</em></strong><em> is the dynamic phase. In this stage we learn to apply the same  principles of mindfulness that we used in the static phase during meditation,  but instead to states that require movement. Here what is needed is to learn to  apply the same control over the mental processes of meditation to movement &ndash;  when one is walking, writing, or giving a lecture. Life becomes a meditation  because we apply the same concentration, the same control, the same interior  harmony to all aspects of our lives &ndash; one learns to be &lsquo;present&rsquo; instead of  escaping from life, instead of being &lsquo;absent.&rsquo; Life takes place in a world of  movement, not in an isolated and static place. Therefore it&rsquo;s important to  develop the techniques necessary to impose this harmony onto the most dynamic  of tempests that is life.</em></p>
                    <p><strong><em>The  third phase</em></strong><em> is more sophisticated because it consists of applying the strategic  precepts of Mamba-Ryu to the mental processes of mindfulness. We are speaking  now of a strategic mindfulness. Here one learns to make a preferential selection,  conscious of what we want to think about in each moment. We learn to focus our  thoughts, consciously aware that there are certain thoughts, certain notions  that are more favorable than others, consciously aware that some are more  conducive to peace and interior harmony while others, to the contrary, will  only bring us misery and unhappiness. We execute a measured control, carrying  out mental movements as if they were pieces on a chessboard and knowing all the  while that the opponent is ourselves.</em></p>
                    <p><strong class="cardinal">What is MAMBA  Mindfulness good for?</strong> <br />
                        <em>Today  in the </em><em>United States</em><em> mindfulness has been used for  some time in anti-stress programs to recover from critical pathologies such as  cardiac problems, cancer, and even AIDS. In every situation what is  indispensable for the patient for physiological/psychological reasons is to  exercise control over their mental-emotional processes. These people need to  learn to live in the present because the present is all they have; the past no  longer exists and the future &ndash; who knows? With mindfulness one learns to  control the mind &ndash; he who controls his thoughts exercises an important  influence over his emotions. Since emotions are a great connection between the  mind and body it&rsquo;s important that these patients learn to manage their minds; one  who controls his mind exercises control over his emotions and one who controls  his emotions exercises control over his body and therefore over life itself.  For people with a nervous personality, mindfulness teaches them to control how  they think, how they feel, how they live, how they &lsquo;are.&rsquo; Mindfulness is also  useful for people who are affected by emotional crises such as depression or  anxiety; these people also need to learn to be present. A depressed person  lives in the past and feels that the tragedies of the past will inevitably  manifest themselves in the future &ndash; they project the past onto the future.  Anxious people fear for the future. That is they feel that the future is going  to bring about some disaster, predictable or not, and they live imagining  possible future calamities. They project an undesirable future over the  present. Anxious and depressed people alike are incapable of appreciating the  present &ndash; both of them live in their minds, emotional victims of mental  processes that have trapped them in the &lsquo;<strong>there and then</strong>&rsquo; instead of  being able to take advantage of the peace of the present moment in the &lsquo;<strong>here  and now</strong>.&rsquo;</em> </p>
                    <p align="right"><strong><em>- Inteview of Elizabeth  Gonz&aacute;lez Musello with Master/Founder James Alexander Guerra Overton</em></strong> </p>
                    <p><em>There  is a Zen story that captures very well the attitude of mindfulness with respect  to living in the present: </em> <br />
                        <em>Once  upon a time there was a monk traveling one evening through the forest. Suddenly  and without warning he was chased by a tiger and in order to escape had to hang  from a vine dangling over a cliff. But while escaping the tiger the monk  discovers that there is another hungry tiger awaiting him below. Hanging there  between two tigers, things only get worse when some rats appear and start  chewing at the vine. Looking around and realizing the catastrophic nature of  the situation, the monk suddenly notices a ripe and tasty wild strawberry just  within his reach. With a smile on his lips the monk plucks the strawberry from  the ground and delights himself in so tasty a morsel.&nbsp; </em> <br />
                        <em>Mamba  Mindfulness teaches one how to live in the present but not for the present.  Life consists of a series of present moments in a continuous flux of time that  begins with the individual&rsquo;s life and continues to a certain end &ndash; death. There  are times when one has to &lsquo;be&rsquo; in the future, because he who does not plan for  his future will be lost in the present. And there are times when one needs to  &lsquo;be&rsquo; in the past, because he who does not understand the past will suffer from  it. But the problem of the human mind is its pathological tendency to escape  from the present; living, suffering, distressing in the past, in the future, in  fantasy, losing sight of the authentic wonders of interior peace and spiritual  harmony that only the present can offer.</em><br />
