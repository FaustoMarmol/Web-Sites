        <td><p><strong class="gold_text"><em>BLACK MAMBA</em> </strong> arises on the one hand as the result of direct   				experience with violence and on the other from the integration   				of a wide spectrum of combative knowledge, all of which combined   				allow for the rejection of ineffectual techniques and tactics as   				well as the ability to adapt others to the necessities of the   				current situation. <strong class="gold_text"><em>BLACK MAMBA </em></strong>is the product of a selective and creative   				synthesis of over 20 different arts.</p>
            <p> <span class="gold_text"><em>BLACK MAMBA</em> is a truly <em>integrated</em> system</span>,   				meaning that it provides an over-arching theme and vision that   				synergistically blends a diversity of components derived from a   				wide-variety of origins and adapted into a uniquely broad,   				encompassing, and proficient combative system capable of   				addressing any aspect of reality. Many modern systems attempt to   				make this claim, but under scrutiny they are but collection of   				mismatched techniques from a variety of other arts or   				competition sports attached together but lacking a series of   				principles, much less a vision, that integrates them into a   				whole; the result is an approached that is doomed to mediocrity   				on all levels. <span class="gold_text"><em><strong>BLACK MAMBA</strong></em> is a cohesive combat paradigm characterized by strategic,   				tactical, and technical integration</span> across ranges and weapons.</p>
          <p> <span class="gold_text"><em>BLACK MAMBA</em> is an integral   				component of a large <em>comprehensive</em> system<strong>,  				MAMBA-Ryu</strong></span>, and as such is the result of integration at a much   				higher level than the mere combative. Although <span class="gold_text"><em>BLACK MAMBA</em> is   				the combative branch of <strong>MAMBA-Ryu</strong></span>, it reflects the profound   				philosophical, cognitive, psychological, and spiritual depths of   				the other aspects of the <strong>MAMBA-Ryu</strong> paradigm, as do MAMBA   				Mindfulness, Imaginoceptive Meta-Programming, and Existential   				Strategy. For this very reason, <span class="gold_text"><em>BLACK MAMBA</em> is an authentic   				&lsquo;<strong>WAY</strong>'</span>. While many martial arts assert the same, the reality of   				the matter is that few actually <em>produce</em> the coherent set   				of premises or principles necessary to constitute a philosophy   				of life, much less a cogent methodology to serve as a guide for   				the student to progress along a path of self-realization.</p>
          <p> <span class="gold_text"><em>BLACK MAMBA </em> focuses on <em>principles,</em> not just   				techniques</span>. Techniques are as limitless as the   				leaves on a tree because they are mere instantiations in a   				particular time and space of a given branch of principles. In   				both <strong class="gold_text"><em>BLACK MAMBA</em></strong> as well as in <strong><em>BLACK MAMBA</em> SITUATIONAL COMBAT </strong> we emphasize   				identifying and comprehending the fundamental psychological,   				philosophical, and physical principles that define the scenario.   				By grasping the underlying principle, the student of <strong class="gold_text"><em> BLACK MAMBA </em></strong> learns how to transcend individual techniques and improvise an   				instantiation of the higher level principle in order to deal   				with the situation at hand.</p>
          <p> <span class="gold_text"><em>BLACK MAMBA </em> teaches each   				application and its <em>shadow</em></span>, that is, its   				reversal, its counter and therefore its weaknesses and   				limitations. Much like a criminal investigator must be capable   				of thinking like the criminal he or she pursues, by learning the   				limitations of a technique we can better prepare ourselves to   				defend against it. For example, it is not by being the <em>best</em> grappler that we can defeat the grappler, but by both   				understanding the limits of grappling AND by being sufficiently   				proficient at grappling that we can neutralize the grappler and   				conduct the battle on our own terms.</p>
          <p> <span class="gold_text"><em>BLACK MAMBA</em> training takes place primarily outdoors</span>,  				 &nbsp;where   				real-life confrontations occur. By training on different   				terrains, uneven surfaces, varying weather conditions, at   				different times of the day or night, and under various   				three-dimensional constraints (water, elevator, car, kitchen,   				etc.), the student develops a familiarity with the many   				situations in which a conflict situation can take place and is   				therefore better prepared to enact a successful response.</p></td>

From his   				earliest infancy he experienced extreme racial violence   				resulting in physical attacks which on more than one occasion   				left him unconscious and abandoned for dead. The effects of   				these encounters affected his physical and emotional health   				causing serious digestive disorders, migraines, allergies, and   				general respiratory problems. At 7 years of age and after having   				sustained emergency-room treatments for asthma attacks,   				Overton's allergist assured him that without a disciplined   				exercise regimen to strengthen his lungs he would most likely   				not live to see his 12th birthday... <a href="BlackMambaHistory.html">(more)</a> </p></td>
