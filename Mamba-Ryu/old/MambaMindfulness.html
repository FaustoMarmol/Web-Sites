              <p align="justify" class="smaller_text"><span class="gold_text"><strong>MINDFULNESS</strong></span><strong>: </strong>Often   							practiced only as a meditative technique,   							Mindfulness is a methodology of the mind that   							precedes Buddhism and is mentioned in sacred Hindu   							texts such as the Bhagavad gita. In essence,   							Mindfulness consists of the ability to concentrate   							on the present moment without allowing oneself to   							become distracted by or attached to thoughts or   							feelings that divert one's attention from the   							present.</p>
              <p align="justify" class="smaller_text"><strong> <span class="gold_text">MAMBA MINDFULNESS</span>:&nbsp; </strong>The Fire   							Sphere of MAMBA, it constitutes the strategic and   							structural adaptation of Mindfulness to the integral   							methodology of MAMBA-RYU.</p>

When the waters of our emotions and   							thoughts are perturbed, things do not appear as they   							are but rather also perturbed and distorted. One of   							the primary objectives of MAMBA Mindfulness is to   							quiet the waters of the mind so that the moon   							reflected upon them is undistorted and we are free   							to experience reality as it is, without delusions.</span></p>

              <p align="justify" class="smaller_text"><strong> <span class="gold_text">MENTE DE AGUA</span>:</strong> (<em>literally, &quot;MIND OF   							WATER&quot;</em>) Just like the   							surface of calm water acts as a perfect mirror,   							&quot;mind of water&quot; refers to the state in which   							turbulent emotions and thoughts are quieted and   							allow for a perception without distortions,   							reflecting things as they are.</p>
