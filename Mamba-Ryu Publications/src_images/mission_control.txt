1. Links page - add bg images that scroll with the content - like an thin, intermediate bg.  Seemingly random images, but they light up on mouseover of
   their relevant link.
2. get at Amazon re. why the author page isn't showing all of our works, damnit! 


From Gustavo-Sempai - Videos to incorporate
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
- This is a video which offers the introduction to one of the evolved programs called : Mente e Identidad del Guerrero Iluminado 
  http://menteidentidaddelguerreroiluminado.blogspot.mx/2011/05/introduccion-al-programa-mente-e.html
- Jimmy sensei, I do not known if you want to add as a part of a whole a link about hypnosis and chamanism, 
  in this link the reader can get a brief information about both plus a 80 minute video with Mayra sempai and
  her hypno-chamanic trance :) http://artesmentalesdelsennin.blogspot.mx/
- This blog might contain some good information about the founder, it provides the curriculum and information about programs 
  of mind control, MAMBA Mindfulness, a little 10 minutes video introduction about the progam in general

Mission Control
* * * * * * * * * * *
Finaling plan:
1. incorporate gustavo sempai's comments re. youtube intros, where appropriate
2. PDF sample files for each book, and fix links
   (No more than 30 pages if it is a long book, but for others no more than 20. I would say no more than 10-15% of the book.)
3. post to github and online, and solicit feedback again
4. request specific commentaries for those books - maybe put de la obra as placeholder for now?
5. DONE!


??? for El Circulo
1. all blogs / other sites including public facebook groups so
   can put all of them on the "links" page
2. need new reviews and descriptions for some books, but when??    
3. how does it look in general?



1. try a non-scrolling bg - how looks?

1. Add symbolism - why the snake, why the snakeskin bg?
2. home page text - book descriptions need to be better?

1. After HR, maybe a description of what MAMBA Ryu is, and what
   the Press is?
2. More something - home page needs more something.  But what?
3. Consider adding tooltips for comment text:
   - http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2012/11/how-to-create-a-simple-css3-tooltip/
   - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17391194/tooltip-with-html-content-without-javascript
   
   
1. Masters of the Art of Mind-Body in Action
   MAMBA-Ryu Publications intend to disseminate knowledge about
   the... (cop from Maestros Kaizen)
2. Change font on the title text (see what appears in the books)
   Provide 2nd, 3rd fallback font options - ultimate fallback
   is current font.
   Maybe try a png?  Hard to get anti-aliasing right though, no?
3. Input descriptions for each book
4. Ask Pops for help w/ descriptions and acclaim
5. Add 'About MAMBA-Ryu' main link

/*
1. chop images for each page, 400 wide front cover and back cover
2. use the front cover, sized to 300 wide to advantage browser caching
3. make a grid for the "titles" page
4. make each of the individual pages, populate with front cover at
   top left, add placeholder text ("If"), and populate with back cover at
   lower right.  Ping Gustavo-Sempai for crtical acclaim content!
5. Remove "links" for now
6. About the Author - link out to Amazon page for now
7. Sobre MAMBA Ryu - use o old site, perchance, to get something out
   there.  Will need to talk to Pops or Gustavo about how relevant
   that content still is.
8. DONE!
