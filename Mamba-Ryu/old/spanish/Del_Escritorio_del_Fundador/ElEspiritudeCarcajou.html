            <td><p>The  trail up the mountain suddenly led into a thick mist that stretched before him  like an ominous white curtain.&nbsp; Absorbed  in his progresshe neither paused nor  contended its place but rather proceeded into it determined to stay the  course.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t for quite a number of  steps that he noticed the complete change of temperature and scenery to what now  seemed like a different world: the warm mountain climate had been replaced by a  near arctic landscape covered in snow and enshrouded in a dense and oppressive  fog. &nbsp;His pace slowly ground to a seeming  halt as he became aware of an eerie sensation that had unexpectedly  materialized within him: <em>fear</em>. </p>
                    <p>At  first the feeling was a knowing impression at the periphery of his awareness  and he simply ignored it, attributing it to the sudden marked change in  temperature and dramatic increase in humidity that impacted his mostly naked  sweaty body. Gradually the sensation had intensified to the point that he had  to attend to it, consider it for it demanded his attention. </p>
                    <p>He  was quite surprised by his own thoughts and he was not sure what they betrayed:  a lack of confidence? Regret? Guilt? Loneliness? What was happening to him?? He  was by himself, with himself, why would he be afraid?!? But he was; in fact he  was overcome with terror. He wanted to cry out, but knew it to be both in vain  and demeaning if the already pathetic feelings he was experiencing within were  manifested to the cosmos. He felt small and insignificant, as if everything he  ever did or could ever do would amount to little more than the silent emptiness  that presently engulfed him; it was as if everything were nothing; it was as if  he himself were nothing; it was as if the immensity of the universe, of nature,  of this very trail and mountain he so arrogantly wished to challenge and fathom  came crashing down on him all at once and crushed him in spirit if not in body.  Running with Wolves! Swimming with Killer Whales! Following the Eagle, <em>his</em> Eagle in the sky! What was wrong with him? Who did he think he was? Something  special? How could he have fooled himself so? How was this possible? Why had he  not drowned in the depths of the bay swimming with the Orcas only to wish to  cease to &lsquo;be,&rsquo; here so close to the summit? What was wrong with him? Where was  his Power, his warrior&rsquo;s Pride? Why did he suddenly break, wimp out, crumble?!? </p>
                    <p>It  was in the midst of this cerebral fog that his mind barely caught a glimpse of an  ephemeral shadow, a furtive blur that made him spin aroundin a wild-eyed panic. What was that?!? &ldquo;Am I going crazy too?&rdquo; he  cried aloud. But as he repeatedly whirled around trying to materialize into a  concrete visual image the flash he was not sure was real or a hallucination, he  noticed that he was disoriented, that he no longer knew which was the path of  return or where his path had been leading; he was stuck, dizzied and lost. It  was at that precise instant that the first attack came. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
                      A  ripping, searing pain that shot through his body like a dagger of ice cutting  him from groin to scalp stopped his very breathing. His back arched as much  from the unexpected abruptness of the event as from the agony of it itself.  Mouth agape and eyes as large as plates he instinctively spun in the direction  of the attack while his brain scrambled to interpret into reality the flood of  cryptic messages that his senses presented. Sheer terror gripped him as he  impulsively reached down to grasp the source of pain at his left rear flank,  only to feel a hot sticky wet substance flowing liberally down his backside and  now over his hand. He caught another ephemeral glimpse of a shadow as it  retreated into he was not sure which direction even as his mind ran through  possible supernatural explanations for what was happening. Frantically glancing  around all he saw were trees and more trees fading into the white  distance.&nbsp; Nothing made sense as terror  clutched his very being, paralyzing his very thought.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
                      The  second attack caught him on his right side and he distinctly felt teeth sinking  into his flesh; instantly he roared in pain. Once again he swerved to get a  visual on his attacker, and yet again it disappeared into the forest without a  trace, like a phantom, like an invisible evil presence that left nothing but  wounds, pain and terror in its wake. The attacks kept coming, now with more  speed and greater frequency. His legs failed him and he collapsed onto the  ground, writhing with agony, shocked that even such a degree of pain was possible  for he had never . . . no! Not true! A flash of memory coming from a wave of  abrupt familiarity, rolled back the years to that place, to that time, and to  that . . . to that helpless state as a child . . . but a child he was no more!  A flicker of anger that soon became a torrent of wrath overtook him,  overwhelming and overriding his agony. Nostrils flared, teeth gritted, lips  curled and snarling like a raging beast, his face became a mask of wild fury as  he regained his feet; no longer content to withstand and avoid he was now  determined to hunt and destroy the angry demon. As if shocked by the transition  of its prey, the shadow materialized to reveal an equally snarling and fearless  adversary: the bloodthirsty Carcajou!</p>
                    <p> Both opponents now circled each other in a  battle to the death as the Carcajou no longer had the advantage of possession  of the man&rsquo;s spirit and heart and had to now fight him solely &ldquo;mano a mano,&rdquo;  from outside his mind and body. The man kicked and the Carcajou nimbly  retreated, the beast lunged and snapped and the man leapt and dodged. &nbsp;Man and beast attacked and defended, neither  making the least progress until suddenly the man, synchronizing his movements  with those of the great mustelid, managed to connect a ferocious kick against  the very muzzle of the beastly ghost, hurling it backwards in a head over tail  tumble across the snow, shrieking like a whipped dog. This incensed the Carcajou  who, wild with fury and hatred, attacked in reckless abandon, and tossing all  caution to the four winds took a prodigious leap towards the man&rsquo;s throat.&nbsp; The man offered his left forearm as a shield  and target for the Carcajou&rsquo;s furious wrath and gaping jaws. The Carcajou  clenched onto the man&rsquo;s left forearm and both of them heard the cracking of the  bones even before the man felt the shock waves of pain that quickly paralyzed  his entire left side. But the warrior would not be stopped. With the lightning  speed that had so often characterized him in battle he dropped down to the  ground, slamming the Carcajou on its back and stabbing his knee in its chest,  pinning it against the snow. In a continuous blood curling frenzy of human and  animal snarls, of animal claws tearing and ripping human flesh, and of human  flesh splattering blood in all directions, the man mercilessly beat the beast  with his right fist until the Carcajou lay a limp mass of broken bones,  battered meat, and flattened tissue and fur. It is doubtful that the man even  registered the bones in his own hands cracking from the tremendous and  relentless impact he imparted upon the skeleton of the spirit-animal.&nbsp; </p>
                    <p>He  did not stop striking until his arm no longer responded to his will to  continue, long after the carcass had relinquished its grip and its life. Chest  heaving with exertion, both hands clenched in white-knuckled fists as his eyes  rolled in their sockets towards the top of his head. Falling back and sitting  on his heels, his head and face upturned to the sky he emitted a primal scream  of rage, desperation, and detachment to all things in a manner that seemed to  howl: &ldquo;This is it? This is it? This is all you have? This is what you sent to  destroy me? I don&rsquo;t care!!! I STILL AM!!!&rdquo; The roar boomed into the mist,  reverberating through the trunks and branches of the forest&rsquo;s trees, echoing  into the far-off mountains. &nbsp;In the  distance the thunder of a great storm replied to his calling. </p>
                    <p>For  moments or hours &ndash; no one knows - he just sat there, exhausted, emptied and  full. Finally, regaining himself he felt his power surge once again and the  will to keep moving suddenly pulled him to his feet. Disoriented still, his  mind delayed in recognizing as snow the flakes of white stuff he just noticed  falling from the sky. The seasoned warrior that he was, he took stock of his  numerous wounds and lacerations as he remembered one of his favorite  expressions:<em> a warrior without scars has  never been to battle.</em>&nbsp; After a  functional assessment of his condition he resolved that he had no choice but to  press on forward, always forward; but where, in which direction? Looking around  for a sign he noticed the figure of the Eagle, <em>his</em> Eagle, calmly resting  atop a branch: he knew that to be the Way.&nbsp; </p>
                    <p>When  he limped to where the Eagle awaited him he looked back at what he had left  behind. He was stunned to see that the carcass of the Carcajou was no longer  that of the mangled and broken furry beast he had left behind, but rather that  of a man &ndash; himself! Even more astounding was the realization that the tracks in  the snow leading from the killing ground to where he now stood were not his,  nor even those of a man, but rather those of the Carcajou itself. </p>
