                  <em>Five Spheres encompass the art of  Mamba-Ryu.&nbsp; The Earth Sphere (Black  Mamba) fashions the body into a versatile and deadly weapon.&nbsp; The Water Sphere (Green Mamba) makes the  student into a Master of survival, an autonomous unit able to independently  thrive in any of the world&rsquo;s habitats, including and perhaps most importantly  the &lsquo;urban jungle.&rsquo;&nbsp; This interview  pertains to two of the lesser known Spheres of Mamba, the realm of the more  advanced practitioner:&nbsp; the Fire Sphere  pertains to the training of the conscious mind and is learned by studying the  discipline of Mamba Mindfulness; the Wind Sphere trains the nonconscious mind  and is learned by studying Hypno-Shamanism.&nbsp;  Only after achieving mastery of these Spheres can a student hope to  attain the Void Sphere, which represents the fusion of the other four into a  comprehensive understanding, a state that like Enlightenment cannot be trained,  only attained.</em></p>
              <p><span class="gold_text">Founder</span>:<br />
                My first  comment would be that there isn&rsquo;t exactly a relationship of equivalency between  the Wind Sphere and Hypno-Shamanism.&nbsp; It  is the case that Imaginoceptive Meta-Programming is something that falls under  the general area of the Wind Sphere, however you have to keep in mind that  every Sphere contains elements of each and every other Sphere.&nbsp; So in a sense the five Spheres of Mamba-Ryu  have what is referred to as a &lsquo;fractal design,&rsquo; where in a fractal a component  contains all aspects of every other component, all the way down.&nbsp; So Mamba Mindfulness, for example, which you  are correct in stating is the primary domain/area of study within the Fire  Sphere, is something that once it&rsquo;s ingrained also applies to the Wind Sphere,  because how to think mindfully or how to control the conscious mind then  becomes a non-conscious process, and that is the mastery a student hopes to  achieve.<br />
                <br />
                So regarding the division in Spheres, think of it more as a  guideline to help people grasp the somewhat elusive paradigm that Mamba-Ryu  presents for those who are accustomed to categories being well-defined.&nbsp; But really the Spheres go beyond categories &ndash;  you can think of them more in terms of &lsquo;tendencies.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Earth Sphere deals primarily with  physical combat, with developing the body into a weapon &ndash; but it is not a mind-less  weapon, it is a mind-<em>full</em> weapon; it  is not a weapon without intent, or a weapon without an awareness of how and  when it should be applied.<br />

                  <em>How will one who has attained  mastery of the Fire Sphere exhibit it as he trains the Earth Sphere?&nbsp; How will he exhibit it as he goes about his  daily affairs?</em></p>
              <p><span class="gold_text">Founder</span>:<br />
                The Fire  Sphere focuses primarily on strategy, strategic thinking &ndash; how to think about  thinking.&nbsp; Mindfulness is an important  aspect of it, but in general it addresses how to think strategically, how to  solve problems, how to break problems down.&nbsp;  An individual who has attained a degree of adeptness, a certain  proficiency in the Fire Sphere is going to be more strategic, is going to be  more tactical in their approach; they&rsquo;re going to be more mindful of what they  should be mindful of &ndash; aspects of the opponent, aspects of themselves.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll have a higher degree of analysis and  a more proficient control over the effort expended &ndash; higher efficiency and higher  efficacy.&nbsp; Having said that, what one  must realize is that whereas the direct application that one would assume of  the Earth Sphere is hand-to-hand combat, for the most part in one&rsquo;s life there  is a very, very small aspect that could threaten your existence.&nbsp; The Fire Sphere is much more focused on how  to deal strategically with <em>adversity</em>.&nbsp; So really you have to invert the order of  those things and think that &lsquo;alright, the Earth Sphere isn&rsquo;t just for making  the body into a weapon, but it&rsquo;s more of a metaphor for the rest of your  existence that doesn&rsquo;t involve necessarily hand-to-hand combat but does involve  adversity in general.&rsquo; &nbsp;And adversity can  of course encompass situations with &lsquo;adversaries,&rsquo; but adversity does not  require a physical or a tangible opponent &ndash; it can consist of attitudes in  ourselves, behaviors that are unwanted, belief systems, schemas; the Fire  Sphere applies to anything that requires the overcoming of adversity.&nbsp; When you are training the higher level of the  Earth Sphere, i.e. the kind of level that someone who is proficient in the Fire  Sphere would bring to it, you would be looking at things not so concretely in  terms of a hand-to-hand combat combative situation, but would instead relate it  to the much broader and (as far as Mamba-Ryu is concerned) much more important aspect  of life in general &ndash; dealing with adversity.<br />
                <br />
  How would he exhibit it going about  his daily affairs?&nbsp; Well, one would pause  at the fundamental axiom of Mamba-Ryu, and that is &ndash; <em>life contains adversity</em>.&nbsp; Adversity  is simply inherent to existence, to being a living being; it is not because  we&rsquo;ve committed some kind of sin or &lsquo;fallen out of grace&rsquo; with the gods or the  universe or inherited sins of our forefathers or reincarnated from another  existence with some kind of state of detriment for which we are accountable &ndash;  it is simply a fact of being alive.&nbsp; You  will encounter adversity.&nbsp; So first of  all, one who is adept at the Fire Sphere will have the attitude that adversity  is something to be expected, something to be dealt with in a <em>methodical</em> <em>way</em>, as opposed to something that you think you&rsquo;re being punished  for or that you hope to avoid in life &ndash; it&rsquo;s just something that you&rsquo;re going  to encounter, so you seek the rules and principles that apply to overcome the  adversity.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re going to examine your  resources and how best to deploy those resources for a resolution to the  situation that is most favorable to you.&nbsp; <br />

              <p><span class="gold_text">Founder</span>:<br />
                The domain  of the Wind Sphere is the non-conscious mind &ndash; that aspect of ourselves which  is the reservoir of our habits, of our emotions, of the reasons why we do the things  we do when there are no reasons; it is the repository of the irrational which  is what defines human beings and therefore human existence.&nbsp; So when someone who is an adept of the Wind  Sphere is practicing the Earth Sphere, they&rsquo;re going to be focusing on the  non-conscious of both themselves and their opponents: &lsquo;what does your opponent  do that they&rsquo;re not aware of the fact that they&rsquo;re doing?&nbsp; Do they have habits?&nbsp; Do they have patterns?&nbsp; Do you have habits and patterns that you&rsquo;re  not aware of?&rsquo;&nbsp; And you&rsquo;re going to focus  on &lsquo;well, how do I identify those habits and those patterns that are presenting  themselves in my behavior and that are detrimental to me &ndash; how do I identify  them and how do I go about modifying/correcting them in some way?&rsquo;&nbsp; And as far as your opponent &ndash; &lsquo;how can I  identify them and exploit them to my advantage?&rsquo;&nbsp; How do you identify the patterns that your  opponent isn&rsquo;t aware of and how do you exploit them?&nbsp;<br />
                <br />
This breakdown, &lsquo;conscious/non-conscious  mind,&rsquo; &lsquo;Fire Sphere/Wind Sphere,&rsquo; gives a sense of a model of the mind in  operation.&nbsp; The model of the mind is  essential to understanding human existence, or how humans exist in this world &ndash;  we do not exist outside of our minds, outside of our thoughts, of our behaviors,  of how we think and how we imagine and how we feel.&nbsp; So the same kind of approach that the adept  took to combat training in which he or she tries to identify which patterns are  not working, modify them, improve on them and create new patterns, he or she would  also look at their life in general &ndash; &lsquo;am I where I want to be? &nbsp;Should I want to be where I am?&rsquo; &ndash; and realize  that most of our behavior is non-conscious in nature.&nbsp; If the answer is &lsquo;no,&rsquo; they&rsquo;re going to want  to identify &lsquo;well, what are those patterns?&nbsp;  What are those habits?&nbsp; What are  those inclinations?&nbsp; What are those  emotions that <em>rule </em>me, that impulse  me, that to a great degree have programmed me, that have led me to the position  that I am in?&rsquo;&nbsp; Taking stock of those  issues may require them to hire a sounding board (which is largely what a  therapist does for example or what an Existential Strategist does) to sort of  help work these things out, to help identify these patterns; and after having  identified them &lsquo;well, how do I modify them?&nbsp;  How do I modify them in order to facilitate my transition from where I  am to where I want to be?&rsquo;&nbsp; Also in the  process of analyzing &lsquo;where am I?&rsquo; is: &lsquo;what&rsquo;s taken me to this point?&nbsp; What are these non-conscious habits, patterns,  decisions, emotions and all these things that have directed my behavior?&nbsp; What are they?&nbsp; How do I get in touch with them, how do I  identify them, how do I modify them?&rsquo;<br />

                  <em>What Fire Sphere and Wind Sphere  skills will one indirectly develop by training the Earth Sphere?&nbsp; Give an example or two please.</em></p>
              <p><span class="gold_text">Founder</span>:<br />
                A more appropriate  question would be: &lsquo;how do the skills, techniques and performance objectives of  the Fire Sphere and Wind Sphere translate into physical combative  applications?&rsquo; because essentially that is what we are looking at.&nbsp; Now, inasmuch as the Wind Sphere has to do  with training the nonconscious mind, when you are in a combative situation the  ideal is to train a series of responses to the point at which they are no  longer conscious.&nbsp; In other words, to the  point at which they are simply intuitive, reflexive &ndash; conscious thoughts do not  need to mediate your responses to a given situation.&nbsp; You respond without thought.&nbsp; So they are in a sense &lsquo;responses without a  responder&rsquo; because the responding is not mediated by any kind of intentionality,  &lsquo;conscious&rsquo; intentionality, even though the action itself will be attributed to  the individual who is objectively seen as carrying it out.&nbsp; But in essence, you just do things without  even being aware of the fact that you&rsquo;re doing them.&nbsp; That is the ideal.&nbsp; And inasmuch as that transfers to physical  combat that is what you&rsquo;re looking for.&nbsp;  You&rsquo;re looking to be so trained that for any given situation you respond  without having to think.&nbsp; <br />
                <br />
                As far as &lsquo;what aspects of the Fire Sphere will be  developed in the Earth Sphere?&rsquo; we&rsquo;re looking at essentially a representation  of the same points.&nbsp; What is the Fire  Sphere all about?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s about strategic  thinking, tactical thinking.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s about  training the conscious mind, in a sense, to think and to strategize, to plan,  to be tactical, automatically.&nbsp; From the  standpoint of the Earth Sphere, which is again combative, you&rsquo;re trying to  elevate your application of techniques beyond simple kick and punch, parry, bob  and weave, into a level in which you are implementing some kind of strategy,  some kind of tactical representation.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re  not just being reactive in an immediate sense to the smaller, lower level  aspects of the situation, but you&rsquo;re taking a broader perspective in mind.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s say, for example, an encounter is beginning  to present itself &ndash; it looks like it&rsquo;s developing; if you&rsquo;re thinking  strategically you would be thinking about positioning.&nbsp; Where is the best <em>position</em> for you to be in to respond to the event?&nbsp; If it&rsquo;s at night and there is a source of  light, well you know that you&rsquo;d want to be with your back to the source of  light so that you&rsquo;d benefit visually from the light shining on your opponent  and yet your opponent would be hampered by the light shining in their faces,  reducing their visibility.&nbsp; <em>Positioning</em>.&nbsp; If the encounter is taking place in a bar you  might want to subtly position yourself where you have access to improvised  weapons: a chair, a bottle, a pool stick, a pool ball.&nbsp; If it&rsquo;s a restaurant: well, a fork, a  knife.&nbsp; If it&rsquo;s a hallway in a hotel then  maybe you&rsquo;d want to be near the fire alarm, or better yet the fire alarm with  the axe to break the glass.&nbsp; So you could  be thinking in terms of positioning.&nbsp; You  would want to automatically bring all those aspects of tactical and strategic  thinking to the combative situation at hand.&nbsp;  Basically, real-life hand-to-hand combat differs significantly from a  ring.&nbsp; A ring is a ring is a ring; it has  a limited number of areas &ndash; you&rsquo;re in the middle of the ring, you&rsquo;re on the  ropes, you&rsquo;re in the corner.&nbsp; Versus real  life &ndash; there are varying configurations of three-dimensional space, so if  you&rsquo;re thinking strategically you would think &lsquo;how can I position myself to take  advantage of those configurations?&rsquo;</p>

                  <span class="cardinal">Apprentice</span>:<br />
                <em>How does the discipline of  Existential Strategy fit into the Fire and Wind Spheres?&nbsp; Does it simply utilize a more mundane subject  matter to both harbor peace within the conscious mind (Fire Sphere) and the  removal of anxiety from the nonconscious mind (Wind Sphere), thereby  facilitating mastery of Mamba Mindfulness and Hypno-Shamanism?&nbsp; Also, how does it stand alone as a  discipline?</em></p>
              <p><span class="gold_text">Founder</span>:<br />
                Well let  me answer the last part first because it reflects upon the rest of the question.&nbsp; Essentially what you have with Existential  Strategy is &lsquo;how to live.&rsquo; &nbsp;How to live  your life; how to be; how to have an existence.&nbsp;  What are the strategies?&nbsp; Inasmuch  as &lsquo;strategy&rsquo; as a term comes from the Greek <em>strategos</em>, <em>strategoi</em>,  meaning General and Generalship, how do you become the General of your  existence?&nbsp; What is the art of being the  General of your existence?&nbsp; With that in  mind &ndash; &lsquo;what is the strategy?&rsquo; &nbsp;Well,  it&rsquo;s a plan &ndash; a methodology &ndash; to obtain an objective with limited available  resources.&nbsp; Existence has many different  facets and many different planes of which physical combat tends to factor  minimally.&nbsp; That is, unless you live a  sociopathic existence as a gang member or a Mafioso, or you&rsquo;re a soldier (and  even then soldiers for the most part spend the majority of their time training  rather than actually fighting) &ndash; for most people in the civilized world  physical combat is a limited aspect of their lives.&nbsp; So, Existential Strategy addresses what else goes  on in someone&rsquo;s life: there are relationships, there are adversities having to  do with one&rsquo;s job, having to do with practically anything.&nbsp; It is the art of being and the art of  applying strategic principles and a strategic mindset to <em>being</em> and to <em>existence</em>.&nbsp; Central to that, first and foremost, are  issues of identity &ndash; who are you?&nbsp; And  that is a huge topic in and of its own.&nbsp; <br />
                  <br />
                Now, how does Existential Strategy stand apart from  Mamba-Ryu per se?&nbsp; Well, it does and it  does not.&nbsp; It does not in that Mamba-Ryu  is all about Existential Strategy.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s  about &lsquo;who are you?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Where are you?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Who do you want to be&rsquo; and &lsquo;how do you get  to where you want to be?&rsquo;&nbsp; Now, when you  operate as an Existential Strategist you are trying to help other people answer  those questions and reach those objectives, but within a different  framework.&nbsp; So, beginning with the notion  of identity, the fundamental framework of identity of a Mamba is different or  could be different from that of a Hindu or that of a Muslim or that of a  Christian or any number of people.&nbsp;  However, the questions, the issues, the problems that they face within  their given framework are very similar.&nbsp;  So they would benefit from applying strategy.&nbsp; They would benefit from wrestling/struggling  with the question of identity:&nbsp; &lsquo;who am I  as a Muslim?&rsquo; &nbsp;&lsquo;Who am I as a  Christian?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Who am I as a Mamba?&rsquo;&nbsp; The Existential Strategist therefore can  assist other people with the questions, keeping in mind their fundamental  frameworks and allowing them also an opportunity to question them.&nbsp; Because if one did not question those  frameworks then what would be the point of faith?&nbsp; Faith without questioning is really stupidity  &ndash; it&rsquo;s just ignorance; unless you have an option then what is the value of your  selection?&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can have any color car you want to as  long as it&rsquo;s black.&rdquo;&nbsp; Well, the whole  issue of the opportunity to select is central to faith.&nbsp; If you believe in black cars then that&rsquo;s only  meaningful if there are white cars and red cars and blue cars and green cars  and silver cars to choose from.&nbsp; So,  Existential Strategy therefore can have two aspects: you can work with people (as  I do) and help them answer the six fundamental existential questions: &lsquo;who am  I?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Who do I want to be?&rsquo; &lsquo;How do I  become that?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Where am I?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Where do I want to be?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;How do I get there?&rsquo; within their own given  framework, <em>or</em> you can address these  questions within the Mamba-Ryu paradigm itself. &nbsp;Then all that remains is to operate within  that framework. </p>

                  The Fire Sphere and Wind Sphere  lead the student along a path to first understanding his mind, learning to  control his mind, and finally to mastering it.&nbsp;  Is understanding our own mind essential to understanding the  enemy&rsquo;s?&nbsp; In what way does it facilitate  the process?</em></p>
              <p><span class="gold_text">Founder</span>:<br />
                 Well the  most important thing to keep in mind (no pun intended) is that the principal  enemy is oneself.&nbsp; The enemy lies within.&nbsp; So inasmuch as that is the true enemy, the  answer would be: well yeah, you have to understand your own mind in order to  understand your enemy&rsquo;s mind because the real enemy lies within.&nbsp; Understanding the nature of the mind is the  first challenge, the great step in the right direction.&nbsp; And it is one of the more controversial  aspects of human learning because it is intimately related to the issue of  identity &ndash; &lsquo;who am I? what am I?&rsquo; etc.&nbsp;  The nature of the mind is enshrouded in the nature of other (associated)  issues such as the soul.&nbsp; Even in psychology  the term <em>suka</em> (psyche), which is the  mind, is also the soul in Greek; for them the mind was the soul.&nbsp; Now, it becomes controversial for people who  believe that the soul is immortal, that the soul is something separate from  aspects of the material body; the model that they&rsquo;re going to have of the mind  is radically different.&nbsp; In order to  understand something you have to begin by asking yourself, &lsquo;well, what is its  essence?&nbsp; What does it consist of?&rsquo;&nbsp; Now, if you&rsquo;re coming from for example a more  neurocognitive perspective in which mind is essentially a manifestation of what  the brain does, even though we don&rsquo;t understand fully what the brain does, then  mind becomes something akin to the gravitational field associated with matter  or the electromagnetic field associated with an alternating current flowing  through an electrical circuit; mind would be another such elemental field or elemental  &lsquo;something&rsquo; that is not really a substance but is just something unique unto  itself.&nbsp; When you have a complex central  nervous system (such as human), you have a mind.&nbsp; So, parting from that, you could then start  building an understanding of what mind is.&nbsp;  However, if you believe that the mind is synonymous with the soul which  is independent of the body, then you&rsquo;re going to have a very, very different  understanding of what is mind and therefore how to go about disciplining  it.&nbsp; </p>

  Give a rough, general curriculum  for the Wind Sphere.</em></p>
              <p><span class="gold_text">Founder</span>:<br />
                If we&rsquo;re  following the general methodology of Imaginoceptive Meta-Programming, also  known as Hypnotic Shamanism, then the first thing is being able to relax one&rsquo;s  body and relax one&rsquo;s conscious mind sufficiently to enable the nonconscious  mind to manifest itself &ndash; what we would commonly call a &lsquo;trance state.&rsquo;&nbsp; Although this kind of communication or  manifestation of the nonconscious mind does not have to be in a trance state,  it is facilitated by the nature of the trance state.&nbsp; In any case, the program would first entail allowing  oneself to enter into this state.&nbsp; One  would develop the capacity to enter into it readily, fully, to begin to experience  what are so-called <em>imaginals</em>, which  are just a manifestation of the dreamscape &ndash; entities that are apparently  autonomous, that have their own volition.&nbsp;  For example, it&rsquo;s akin to when you are asleep and dreaming &ndash; the cast of  characters that appear in the dreamscape are not something that you&rsquo;re  consciously controlling, consciously moving; on the contrary they are  independent of your &lsquo;self,&rsquo; of your &lsquo;will,&rsquo; of your &lsquo;conscious will.&rsquo;&nbsp; But they are of course manifestations of your  nonconscious mind.&nbsp; Keep in mind that in  a Shamanic culture the beliefs could be such that one is actually in a  different dimension of reality and that these are actually autonomous  entities.&nbsp; In short, in the trance state  you would want to develop to the point where you have imaginals, you have a  dreamscape, and you have interaction with those imaginals.&nbsp; The imaginals are  representations/manifestations of your nonconscious mind, and you soon learn to  establish a free and open communication with the nonconscious mind by way of  using these imaginals.&nbsp; <br />
                <br />
                The next level could be (for example) the capacity to  experience shape-shifting along with a <em>familiar </em>&ndash; your <em>power animal</em>.&nbsp; You would identify your power animal, which  may be a tiger, a wolf, a horse, etc., and then shape-shift in the trance state  into that power animal, thus adopting the positive qualities that you attribute  to that animal, and finally carrying on those qualities into the rest of your  existence.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a very powerful  shamanistic technique.&nbsp; And we see this  technique expressed for example in kung fu in the different animal forms, in  which one not only executes techniques and tactics attributed to these animals  but also psychological characteristics of the animals themselves.&nbsp; So that would be sort of the outline for a  basic, fundamental and essential development of the Wind Sphere using the  technique that we refer to as Imaginoceptive Meta-Programming, also known as Hypnotic  Shamanism.</p>

                The conscious mind can be used to effect  change and &lsquo;reprogram&rsquo; the nonconscious mind, and vice versa.&nbsp; So it seems that there would be considerable  overlap in the scope (and therefore the training) of the Fire and Wind  Spheres.&nbsp; If a student studied both  Spheres, what understanding could he expect to achieve at each &lsquo;stage&rsquo; as he  slowly progressed to become a Master?</em></p>
              <p><span class="gold_text">Founder</span>:<br />
                First of  all we must come to terms with the fact that the mere words that we use are  representations, and not very good ones at that.&nbsp; We really lack the proper terminology to  understand the mind.&nbsp; So when we speak of  &lsquo;conscious mind&rsquo; and &lsquo;nonconscious mind&rsquo; the impression that it gives is that  they are two separate and distinct entities, two separate and distinct faculties.&nbsp; But really they are not.&nbsp; They are simply two different phases or  expressions of something that the brain does that we call &lsquo;mind.&rsquo;&nbsp; Having said that, of course there&rsquo;s going to  be considerable overlap between the two.&nbsp; <br />

                Let me give you an example of what conscious/nonconscious  processes are.&nbsp; A conscious process would  be learning to drive a standard, a stick shift.&nbsp;  Once you get down the movements, the synchronization and the timing of  the clutch and the gears and the accelerator and so on, and you no longer need  to think about it, then you&rsquo;re able to carry out other functions and think  about other things while a different aspect of the nonconscious mind (as we  refer to it) can carry out the once-trying task of shifting gears and driving  the vehicle.&nbsp; Now, experimentally there  was a researcher (from the University of Oregon, I believe) who used a  functional Magnetic Resonant Imaging paradigm to show how initially when we  learn a task areas of the frontal lobes (the areas basically behind your  forehead) are engaged, they are heavily activated as one carries out the task &ndash;  because you need to <em>think about it</em>.&nbsp; However, once the task becomes more  automatic, once the task becomes something that you can just <em>do</em>, and do while your attention is  diverted somewhere else, then the activation moved away from the frontal areas  towards so-called parietal areas (which is kind of towards the rear of your  skull).&nbsp; So, different parts of the brain  are now engaged in performing the task; what your brain is trying to do, essentially,  is designate tasks that you don&rsquo;t want to have to think about (that you want to  be automatic) to the nonconscious mind.&nbsp;  However, you want to have the power of override because sometimes there  are habits that you want to change &ndash; behaviors that are automatic that you want  to be aware of, examine and reprogram.&nbsp; In  effect, you want to consciously be aware of those tasks so you can examine them  &ndash; you want to take them out of their state of automatic processing, for lack of  a better term, to monitor them, scrutinize them, make the necessary  adjustments, cut out the bad habits, become more effective, more efficient in  our movements, in our patterns of conduct of behavior, and then reintegrate  them into our wide variety of nonconscious tasks that we carry out daily.&nbsp; Most people can chew gum and walk at the same  time without tripping or choking on their gum.&nbsp;<br /> 
                <br />
                One who has developed a certain amount of expertise in  managing the conscious and nonconscious processes would, for one thing, <em>monitor </em>their mind; they develop a  mindfulness, a meta-consciousness, a meta-awareness of what they are doing in  certain circumstances.&nbsp; And they would be  examining not just their conscious processes but their nonconscious ones &ndash;  those which are automatic &ndash; and try to become aware of them to ask themselves &lsquo;is  this appropriate?&nbsp; Is this what I should  be doing?&rsquo;&nbsp; And if not, they make a  conscious change.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a tricky subject,  because meta-awareness (and this is where it becomes rather tricky and  confusing) should be so ingrained that it is nonconscious &ndash; in other words  automatic.&nbsp; So there&rsquo;s a point in time in  which the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the end meet; that which is  conscious and that which is nonconscious are just really terms that we use to  try to facilitate communication.&nbsp; But you  have to keep in mind that we don&rsquo;t really have the tools, much less the  terminology, to really speak of the mind.&nbsp; <br />
                <br />
                In progressing to mastery, the first thing the person is  going to be aware of is just what processes are automatic, what processes are  not, and become familiar with his or her mind.&nbsp;  As far as being able to describe the experiences and the &lsquo;levels,&rsquo;  that&rsquo;s like trying to describe sex to a virgin &ndash; it&rsquo;s just impossible.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s experientially based.&nbsp; You go about at one level, experiencing that level,  and only at that point would you have the necessary understanding to be able to  comprehend what comes next.&nbsp; For example,  it&rsquo;s not like you can describe a gymnastics routine and say &lsquo;well you start off  and you&rsquo;re going to learn how to do cartwheels and round-offs and then by the  end you&rsquo;re going to be able to do triple pikes or what have you&rsquo; &ndash; it&rsquo;s just  not like that.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s something that you  have to experience.&nbsp; As I mentioned  previously, the reason why we lack the terminology to describe these things is because  they are experiences, and as such they are really ineffable.&nbsp; What I can say with certainty is that you  become a more integrated human being.&nbsp;  You become more aware of who you are, where you are, why you are where you  are, why you&rsquo;re not where you would want to be, what are the mistakes and the  patterns, where they come from and how to go about changing them.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a continual, never-ending process.&nbsp; You never reach perfection, you just reach  another newer higher level.&nbsp; And of  course now we&rsquo;re using metaphors of space because one could also say &lsquo;deeper&rsquo;  and still have the same idea in mind.&nbsp;  You reach a more <em>sophisticated</em>,  if you will, a more profound overarching over-reaching understanding of who you  are and what you are, and what&rsquo;s important to you.&nbsp; So it is never-ending, much like Kaizen is  never ending.&nbsp; <em>Constant improvement</em>.</p>
