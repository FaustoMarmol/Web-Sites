            <td><p>If you were to ask me  &quot;what is <em>Existential Strategy</em>?&quot; and I responded with &quot;It  is the Tao of MAMBA-Ryu&quot; then this answer would be neither informative nor  helpful, for it would simply postpone the inevitable and still beg the further  question: &quot;what is the Tao of MAMBA-Ryu?&quot; Language itself stands in  the way of experiential communication: experience is multidimensional, it  occurs at many levels, conscious and non-conscious alike - and in real time.  Language is linear, sequential. Therein lies the first problem. If you ask me  what an apple tastes like when you have never even seen an apple I will  admittedly be at a loss; if you ask me what it feels like to be in love and you  have never cherished another person so much that the mere thought of being  without them for any length of time causes a ripping, tearing sensation in your  chest, then my best attempt at an explication will be wanting at best, and at  worst fail miserably. I recall being 12 years of age and asking my father what  was the big deal about sex. I also recall the look of disgust on his face when  he turned to me and said &quot;ask me again in five years,&quot; and realized  that I must have just asked something very stupid: When it comes to the most  important aspects of life there is simply no substitute for experience. So when  I tell you that <em>Existential Strategy</em> is coping with the absurdity of  life without falling victim to the illusion of control you may not have a clue  as to what I am saying, or you may get it in an instant. <br />
              <br />
                 Absurdity is what most characterizes  our world, especially our postmodern world. As a hypnotherapist and as an  intern in clinical psychology I have dealt with the effects of this absurdity  on a daily basis for years. I have and will argue that the mass consumption of  mind-numbing and altering substances that characterizes the postmodern world in  general and the capital of the first world - the United States - in particular  is simply an attempt to make ourselves insane enough so that the absurdity of  the world becomes less overwhelming, less apparent, less threatening and almost <em>normal</em>. You are not feeling, much less aware of anything beyond the  immediate rush when you are high on crystal-meth. There is no mystery as to why  the United States with only 15% of the world  population consumes 60% of the world production of illicit narcotics: sometimes  in coping with absurdity we need all the help we can get. If you don't  understand this then you have not been sober enough to witness the absurdity of  a country who voted the Bush administration in for a second term.<br />

I have spent decades of my life  studying, experiencing, and healing the mind, the human condition. As a  professor of the <em>Psychology of Religion</em> I begin my course tracing the  evolution of our species, and the development of the modern mind-brain that  leads to language, abstract thought, spirituality and what I coined <em>the  shamanic perspective</em>; all manifestations of that uniquely developed human  capacity we call <em>imagination</em>. I review with my students the research  that began with my master's thesis on shamanism and culminated with the  experiments of my second master's thesis and of my doctoral dissertation on  imagination and hypnosis, shamanic journeying, and mysticism. I take them  through the theoretical, empirical and clinical work that led me to establish  that the shamanic journey and the hypnotic trance were one and the same  neuro-physiological phenomena, culturally and contextually adapted. We spend a  great deal of time in that course discussing the resulting anxiety that  imagining the loss of our own life, the potential loss of a child, parent, job,  or <em>control</em> creates, the role that emotional complexity plays in a social  animal and how imagination can affect that emotional complexity. Therefore,  when I define religion in the context of such a course of study as <em>imagination  managing imagination</em> my students are prepared &ndash; at least intellectually &ndash;  to comprehend the definition. &nbsp;Yet when they ponder the consequences, the  meaning, the implications of such a definition and how that impacts their lives  I can see in some the joy, the freedom that this occasions and in many others  the horror. There is freedom in realizing that we have no <em>real</em> control  and that even if there are such entities as spirits, gods, goblins, devils,  demons beyond manifestations of the mind-brain itself no one has ever devised a  methodology to make them do our bidding in a reliable fashion. Hence the <em>theodicy</em> problem (aka the &quot;Job topic&quot;): how do we deal with the absurdity of  an omnipresent, omniscient, and omnipotent deity in a world where the good  suffer and the evil are not always punished? Religion is imagination <em>managing</em> imagination, not controlling it, not dominating it. Imagination has a mind of  it own. (My course on the <em>Psychology of Imagination</em> &ndash; a field which I pioneered  and which synthesizes work from fields seemingly as disparate as cognitive  evolution, health psychology, cognitive neuro-science, clinical hypnosis,  psychology of world religions, shamanism, mysticism, Eastern philosophy,  Spanish literature, martial arts, and others - is dedicated to an  interdisciplinary study of this very topic.)<br />
<br />
As a professor of <em>World Religions</em> my task is different. I must present in a fair and objective manner the  essential paradigm which each of the major religions of the world presents, all  in the context of their history and evolution, emphasizing their development  over time, their major changes and the causes for such. (Incidentally, to the  extent to which I am objective in presenting the various religious traditions,  not a single student of thousands has <em>ever</em>, even by the end of a  semester been able to ascertain what my religious beliefs are, or even whether  I am an atheist, a deist, a theist or an agnostic, a fact of which I am  particularly proud and which has troubled to distraction more than one of my  pupils.) But in order to establish that fair and objective standpoint in an  area in which there is bound to be controversy I need to set some ground rules.  To this effect, and on the very first day of classes I emphasize to my students  that the single most important fact, not <em>idea</em>, but <em>concrete fact</em> to take away from the course, long after the details and the dates are  forgotten, details and dates which I myself admit to having to re-remember as I  prepare for the same lecture time and time again, is that all religions have  three things in common: 1) all religious adherents hold their beliefs to be as  dear to them as those of others, so we must respect the human value of these  beliefs even if we do not agree with them; 2) all religions fail to pass the  test of critical scrutiny once the evidence of the <em>validity</em> of their  beliefs is thoroughly examined &ndash; if they did not then what would the point of <em>faith</em> be?; and 3) to accept that in many cases the sacred premises of one religion  contradicts those of some other religious tradition in substantial and  irrefutable ways.<br />
<br />
I  emphasize these three points in the context of the First Amendment of the  Constitution of the United States and what is meant by freedom of  religion: my right to swing my sacred beliefs ends where my neighbor's sacred  nose begins. I dedicate a couple of lectures to the topic of religious  fundamentalism, its definition and its social implications, and one lecture at  least to religious fundamentalist terrorism. Post 9/11 and especially in the United States there is a need to fully understand  that absolute religious Truths with a capital 'T' are <em>personal values</em> and that as socially imposable standards of conduct they are incompatible with  a free society. Religious fundamentalism <em>by definition</em> does not refer to  individuals who are committed to certain beliefs and adhere to them absolutely  &ndash; this is religious <em>orthodoxy</em>. Religious fundamentalism encompasses the  need for a social and political agenda. Religious fundamentalists are those  individuals who feel that an indispensable part of their sacred duty is the  obligation to impose their convictions on a social and political plane. It is  less challenging to reason with one who suffers from paranoid schizophrenia  about his paranoia than to make a religious fundamentalist see, let alone  accept, the logical inconsistencies in his own doctrine &ndash; of this I can assure  you: At least the former presents a diagnosable pathology for which medication  is an option, whereas the latter is socially functional and acceptable enough  to become President of the United States and commit innumerable crimes against  humanity. No conflict between humans is more embittered, cruel, or implacable  than when religious values are at stake or at root. <br />

Where  does that leave us? It leaves us with freedom of choice. I can choose to be a  Muslim, or a Jew, or a Christian, or a Buddhist, etc., and know that I have no  need to justify my faith other than by my own free choice, my own free will.  But this freedom does come at a cost: one cannot resort to proof, to reason, to  evidence &ndash; historical, material, or otherwise &ndash; to validate that choice for it  is a choice and like most choices in life it is based on non-conscious  tendencies, most of which are not justifiable or rational: Why am I in love? We  have become so accustomed, so indoctrinated into believing that we are rational  animals rather than rationalizing animals, that we become offended when it is  explained, rationally, that the basis of our behavior is irrational. Descartes  was in error. <br />
<br />
People  who do not understand something, who are ignorant of it feel threatened by it.  As an African American, Native American, Spanish male who grew up largely in a  Caucasian dominated society I have experienced this fact on a regular basis.  Science is simply the methodology of knowledge, how to acquire it, how to  decide what constitutes knowledge &ndash; what we do with knowledge once we have it  is another issue. As a cognitive neuro-scientist, however, someone who has  spent countless hours in the lab <em>doing the work</em> and seeking answers to  the questions posed by the mind and brain in all its facets, rational and  emotive, I am another type of minority, and for those threatened by such a  fact-finding mission, I am the worst kind: a scientist dedicated to uncovering  the secrets of the psyche, the mind, the soul, the seat of all that is 'the  sacred' emanating from a three pound piece of flesh. Many would say this is <em>absurd</em> and then go straight to their psychiatrist to be prescribed their narcotic of  choice to deal with their depression, come home to self-medicate by having a  drink to calm their 'nerves', or bring me their child in hopes that  neurofeedback will help their ADHD. As a cognitive-neuroscientist I know that  perhaps the most characteristic task of the brain is to process and generate  patterns. The brain, the mind, loves patterns. It detests, abhors the random,  the chaotic, the unsystematic, the indiscriminant, why . . . the . . . absurd! <br />
<br />
Accepting  the absurd, dealing with the absurd, begins with recognizing the illusion of  control and seeing through the control that certain illusions of culture and  mind present. And if you ask me again, &quot;what is <em>Existential Strategy?</em>&quot;<em>,</em> I will tell you what it is about: it is about transcending the absurdity of the  world, of life, without succumbing to the illusion of control; it is about  knowing when and how to pick and choose your own illusions while not deceiving  yourself about their illusory nature; as the Chinese say: &quot;a maker of  idols is not an idolater.&quot; The difference between a fool and a wise man is  that the fool experiences and accepts the illusions before him as inescapably  real, whereas the wise man recognizes not just the illusions for what they are,  but also experiences and accepts the inescapable reality of the fools who  sustain and foment them. </p>
