            <td><p align="justify">One cannot begin to comprehend a methodology as profound and as  extensive as Hypno-Shamanism without understanding first how it came into  being, what are its foundations, its origins.&nbsp;  Only by knowing its prehistory can one begin to appreciate the magnitude  of what it offers as a therapeutic methodology, as a means towards  self-discovery and self-improvement.&nbsp;<br />
              <br />
                Hypno-Shamanism, also known as <em>Imaginoceptive  Meta-Programming</em>, is born on the one hand by an interdisciplinary study of  shamanism and hypnosis, mysticism and world religions, and on the other hand by  extensive research into the cognitive and affective neurosciences, clinical  psychology, cognitive psychology, cognitive behavioral therapy, health psychology,  and psychology of religion.&nbsp; <br />
                <br />
                Inspired by challenging questions, provocative curiosities &ndash; subversive even  &ndash; Hypno-Shamanism arises as a result of a scientific, analytic, and systematic  exploration into the world of human spirituality, mythical beliefs, and the  transcendental needs of the human being.&nbsp;  The result for those who have experienced it is a new perspective on <em>being</em> human and on the human being: a  series of experiences that on the one hand connects the individual with shamans  and mystics across time and on the other has him realize, if he is honest with  himself, the infinitely creative powers of the organ of the imagination.&nbsp; <br />
                <br />
                It was about halfway through the 1980s when my personal reading led me  to a series of books by Carlos Castaneda, the mysterious author of Brazilian  origin (as far as I know, for his origins are still in question) that began his  career as an author by converting his anthropology doctoral thesis on his  apprenticeship with a Yaqui sorcerer named Don Juan Matus into a popular book  that would later become a collection of writings.<br />
                At that time I was living in Toronto, working on the last contract of my career as  a systems analyst; nevertheless the collection of works by Castaneda fascinated  me as it did many thousands if not millions of readers.&nbsp; To me the teachings of Don Juan resonated in  a special way; his philosophy of life emphasized a martial, warrior outlook  which tied into the martial tradition I had lived my entire life.&nbsp; Indeed, the lessons of Don Juan, their spiritual-psychological-philosophical  content were paradigmatic of the teachings that legendary masters of the  martial arts imparted upon their apprentices.&nbsp;  They touched upon issues common to the mystical, the esoteric, and even the  magical traditions of the Oriental practices of Yoga, the martial arts,  Hinduism, Tibetan Buddhism, etc., all of which I had been exposed to since I  was a child.&nbsp; <br />
                <br />
                My one year contract with Honeywell ended in the late spring of 1986.&nbsp; That same summer, shortly after turning  twenty three, I moved to Kingston, Ontario to enroll in Queen&rsquo;s University. My plan was  simple: finish the degree in computer science I had begun several years earlier  at the University of Ottawa, maybe complete a Master&rsquo;s degree in the same  discipline, then return to the field of professional consulting where I would  earn even more money and retire and produce my own software before the age of  thirty.&nbsp; <br />
                <br />
                The reality was quite different &ndash; the department of computer science was  infested with failed mathematicians who sought any excuse to turn computer  science exams into tests on mathematical theory.&nbsp; For me, who detested theoretical mathematics,  the result was predictable &ndash; if all my computer science projects received top  marks, by comparison my exam results were truly humiliating, reflecting poorly  on my final grades.&nbsp; <br />
                <br />
                To achieve any substantial change in life one must arm oneself with  three things: honesty to recognize that there is a problem; perspicacity to  realize the nature of the problem; and the audacity to take the bull by the  horns and do something about it.&nbsp; It  didn&rsquo;t take me long to realize that the real problem wasn&rsquo;t so much the  department but myself &ndash; I was swimming upstream, against my own nature, and it  was about time that I was sufficiently perspicacious, audacious, and honest  with myself that I would follow what Don Juan Matus called a<em> &ldquo;path with a heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; </em><br />
                <br />
                My real fascination was with the mind and human nature, and I tried to  reconcile this hidden passion with the field of computer science by way of the  study of artificial intelligence in the new discipline of the future known as &ldquo;cognitive  science.&rdquo;&nbsp; I changed my major but soon  realized that nothing substantial had changed.&nbsp;  At the time at least, Queen&rsquo;s had no idea what the cognitive sciences  were: what Queen&rsquo;s called a new discipline was only a program of combined and  disconnected computer science and psychology courses &ndash; I spent half the day in  the same classrooms and with the same professors as before. <br />
                <br />
                Yet again disappointed, I soon changed my major to psychology &ndash; the science  of the &ldquo;psyche,&rdquo; mind, or soul &ndash; consoling myself with the idea that despite  the fact that I had abandoned a great part of my intellectual patrimony (inherited  by working with my father as a programmer/analyst) that I was still at least in  a branch of the sciences.&nbsp; But a new  disappointment would not be far off: what I found of interest in the field were  not the typical topics of experimental psychology such as memory, perception  and language, but rather &lsquo;forbidden&rsquo; topics that were at the very least unknown  to the mental sciences of the time, topics such as &lsquo;mind,&rsquo; &lsquo;consciousness&rsquo; or &lsquo;intuition.&rsquo;&nbsp; Since my adolescence I had wanted to know  what the real limits of the human mind were and what comprised this &lsquo;human nature&rsquo;  that was so often mentioned.&nbsp; <br />
                <br />
                I found that the Department of Psychology was completely dominated by  behaviorists &ndash; they only studied behavior because it was observable.&nbsp; Topics of interest to me such as the neuropsychology  of dreaming were taboo: from their point of view a dream cannot be observed so  how could we be sure that it actually exists?&nbsp;  During the hours that I spent watching rats run through a maze I never  stopped asking myself &ndash; &lsquo;what does this have to do with human nature?&rsquo;<br />
                <br />
                Meanwhile, while my internal scholastic struggles ensued my mother, a  writer, had convinced me to enroll in some courses in the Department of Spanish  and Italian in hopes of lightening and balancing my computer science load.&nbsp; I started taking courses in literature and in  Spanish and Latin American culture and civilization, topics I had not studied  since my secondary schooling in Spain.&nbsp; It was  ironic that I would have to go to the other side of the world, far away from Spain and studying under English, Scottish, and even  Italian professors, to come to appreciate the beauty and depth of Hispanic  culture &ndash; my maternal patrimony. &nbsp;My  introduction to the arts and Iberian American culture took place with a new and  special appreciation for the manner in which such writers as Cervantes,  Quevedo, B&eacute;cquer, Paz, Borges, Asturias and Azuela captured the essence of human  nature and the human condition, while psychology spent its time smelling rat  feces. One fine day I decided to accept my new destiny &ndash; I had to admit that my  master plan would never take place.&nbsp; I  went to the university registrar&rsquo;s office and changed my major to Spanish and Latin  American Studies in the Department of Spanish and Italian.&nbsp; My life was about to take an unexpected and new  direction in which I had traded the security of a predictable career as a  programmer and systems analyst for the uncertainty of a <em>path with a heart</em>.&nbsp; </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="justify">Towards the end of my bachelor&rsquo;s degree I had discovered that I wanted  to investigate the world of the sorcerer Don Juan and the works of Carlos Castaneda.&nbsp; The problems of the &lsquo;how&rsquo; and the &lsquo;where&rsquo;  were resolved when I managed to get a professor of the department, Diego  Bastianutti, who had his own interests in such a study taking place, to offer  himself as an academic advisor.&nbsp; The difficulty  was that a study of such magnitude was beyond the scope of a mere Bachelor&rsquo;s  degree.&nbsp; The solution then was to continue  my studies in the department as a Master&rsquo;s student of Spanish and Latin  American Literature with Bastianutti as my advisor.&nbsp; <br />
                <br />
                My objective was to analyze the work of Castaneda for my Master&rsquo;s thesis,  but after doing some research it turned out that Castaneda never wrote directly  in Spanish or Portuguese; therefore despite the fact that he was Latin  American, his work was not classified as such.&nbsp;  I had no choice but to find another subject for my thesis, but I did not  give up completely on the topic of Castaneda&rsquo;s master-sorcerer.&nbsp; <br />
                <br />
                During my studies of Latin American literature I had realized that the  character of the sorcerer, or <em>brujo</em>,  was quite common, and that an inherent degree of esotery factored significantly  into these works &ndash; the same esotery that literary genres such as magic realism,  or the marvelous real were trying to capture for the implicit reader, that is,  the educated western reader.&nbsp; There was a  &lsquo;common denominator&rsquo; with the works of Castaneda, a pattern to discover, but it  was difficult to articulate in concrete terms, difficult to identify the  pattern for the purposes of a research proposal.&nbsp; Given a variety of points that appear to be  randomly distributed, identifying the model of a theory is akin to finding a  relation between these points in a manner that reveals a clear, elegant, and  succinct design.&nbsp; The truth is that it  became very slippery to identify the schema, the relationship between Don Juan,  magic realism, sorcery, etc, although intuitively I knew it existed.&nbsp; I was certain that no one, including the patron  author of magic realism himself, Gabriel Garcia M&aacute;rquez, could clearly define magical  realism &ndash; the literary genre in which he had won a Nobel Prize; and to make  matters worse anthropologists could not even agree upon a definition of a <em>sorcerer</em> or of <em>sorcery</em>.&nbsp; <br />
                <br />
                As time passed my advisor was losing his patience with the topic &ndash;  either I found gold quickly or had to abandon the mine and look elsewhere.&nbsp; It was in this context that one evening,  while I waited for the bus to arrive on my way to the campus, by chance I grabbed  a small book that I had bought some time ago in Toronto, a book that every time  I went to read I had put down, turned off by the strange characters drawn on  the cover &ndash; mythological beings congregating around an old man with a long  white beard dressed as a magician or a wizard.&nbsp;  But that evening, in a hurry and for lack of time to find another because  the bus was arriving, I had no choice but to accept the company of that weird  book.&nbsp; <br />
                <br />
                Once seated on the bus I opened the book and in less than five minutes  realized right there and then that I had stumbled upon the exact missing piece to  the puzzle. I had found what I needed to link magic realism, the marvelous  real, Don Juan Matus, magic, witchcraft, sorcery and the sorcerer, and much,  much more.&nbsp; The book, written by  anthropologist Michael Harner, was entitled <em>The  Way of the Shaman</em>, and nothing would be the same in my vision of the world  or of human reality.<br />
                <br />
                My Master&rsquo;s thesis claimed two hundred pages instead of the permitted  fifty to a hundred, and took me almost three years to write.&nbsp; Entitled in English &ldquo;<em>Shamanism and the Shamanic Perspective in the Analysis of Works of  Magic Realism: A Study Applied to Two Works of Gabriel Garcia M&aacute;rquez</em>,&rdquo; it  was an interdisciplinary study that was really psychological anthropology  applied to literature.&nbsp; The <em>&ldquo;shamanic perspective&rdquo;</em> was a term that I  coined to capture the reality schema, the viewpoint of the world proper of  shamans and shamanic cultures.&nbsp; It is  this perspective that allows one to understand the magical beliefs that have  dominated not only aboriginal cultures around the world since the beginning of  the human species, but have also formed the basis for the religious beliefs of  the world, including the mythology and esotery of superstitions and occultism, witchcraft  and sorcery.&nbsp; <br />
                <br />
                My theory was well grounded although the committee would have liked it  applied to more than only two works by the same author, a task which I later accomplished  in an extensive article entitled <em>&ldquo;Shamanic  Realism: Latin American Literature and the Shamanic Perspective.&rdquo; </em>&nbsp;But given the obvious effort that the theory  required, which made it more appropriate as a Doctoral thesis rather than a mere  Master&rsquo;s, it was certainly understandable that the application was so limited.&nbsp; To all intents and purposes my thesis defense  took place without any significant incidents, that is, until at the very end  when Professor Omar Basab&eacute;, one who had accepted the ubiquity of the <em>shamanic perspective</em>, asked me &ldquo;why?&rdquo;&nbsp; In other words, &ldquo;why did this universal  tendency take place in the human being?&rdquo;&nbsp;  The question was genuine and sincere, an earnest indication of the  fascination he shared with all those present for the topic at hand.&nbsp; In retrospect it was a question that was at  once innocent and obvious: if I told you that the basis of life as we know it  is the carbon molecule, the next reasonable question to ask would be &ldquo;why, what  is so special about the carbon molecule?&rdquo;&nbsp;  That is, as we say, &lsquo;basic,&rsquo; &lsquo;elementary.&rsquo;&nbsp; But to understand to what degree Basab&eacute; had  &lsquo;rained on my parade,&rsquo; you would have to realize that when you are dedicated to  the impossible sometimes the obvious escapes you.&nbsp; It had not even occurred to me, and the  corresponding sensation was that if I had not seen something so obvious, what  else had I overlooked?&nbsp; <br />
                <br />
                Since it wasn&rsquo;t the right time for philosophical self-inquiry but rather  for quick responses, instead of remaining mute I replied with an answer to a  related question so that even if I didn&rsquo;t know the <em>complete</em> answer, I would show that I did have some general  ideas.&nbsp; I then substituted the &lsquo;<em>why&rsquo;</em> of Basab&eacute;&rsquo;s question with the &lsquo;<em>how</em>,&rsquo; indicating that although it was  outside the realm of the study, my research indicated that there was something  particular about the central nervous system of homo sapiens, something that  leant itself to this broad perspective of reality.&nbsp; Given that all human beings share the same  brain, it was logical then that this &lsquo;something&rsquo; would also manifest itself  universally.&nbsp; The reply seemed to satisfy  if not Basab&eacute; himself then the rest of the committee, and without further ado  in February 1994 I was granted the title of <em>Maestro</em> - Master of Arts.&nbsp; <br />
                <br />
                Later there was talk of completing the study at the level of a Doctoral  program, applying my new theory to other works, but first I had unfinished  business that needed settling &ndash; not knowing the answer to Basab&eacute;&rsquo;s question  haunted me endlessly.&nbsp; Why did human  beings tend so universally toward the <em>shamanic  perspective</em>?&nbsp; If it took me a while  to even understand the depths of the question, it took me ten years to arrive  at a satisfactory answer.&nbsp; When finally I  had the peace of mind necessary to understand what the question implied, I  realized that I lacked the necessary knowledge to answer it.&nbsp; I felt as a mountain climber who had exhausted  himself reaching a peak only to discover at the summit a new chain of peaks,  even higher than my own. With a simple and innocent question Basab&eacute; had robbed  me of the glory of my triumph &ndash; what I had thought was the end of the road was  just the beginning. <br />
                <br />
                I understood the &lsquo;what&rsquo; of shamanism and had some idea of the &lsquo;how,&rsquo; but  the &lsquo;why&rsquo; was still far off.&nbsp; Based on my  previous research I learned that I could not directly engage the question of the  &lsquo;why&rsquo; without having a better understanding of the &lsquo;how&rsquo; &ndash; I had to re-equip  myself for a new journey, a new mission: the neuro-physiological and  psychological study of the shamanic journey, as it was only there that I could  begin to define the answers to that question.&nbsp;  I contacted several neurosciences graduate programs only to discover  that the discipline was highly specialized, meaning dedicated to the study of  small mechanisms such as the role a certain protein plays in the synapses between  two neurons, or how one&rsquo;s levels of dopamine (a neurotransmitter associated  with motor function, emotions, and feelings of pleasure) responded to certain  pharmaceutical products.&nbsp; <br />
                <br />
                To understand this mentality, the mindset of the neurosciences, one must  understand the methodology of reductionism that dominates the majority of the  experimental sciences.&nbsp; Reductionism is  the name of an ideological current that believes that the only way to study a  system is by a comprehension of its basic, smallest components.&nbsp; The idea is that if you don&rsquo;t understand how  a watch works you dissemble it and study its parts, and if these results prove  too complex you apply the same procedure until finally you arrive at a  component so simple and so small that you can understand it completely.&nbsp; Once all the smallest parts have been  understood, then you start reassembling to understand the relationship between  them, repeating the process until you have a complete watch and an  understanding of how it works.&nbsp;  Reductionism is proper for classical physics where the interaction  between the parts is clearly defined and governed according to rules that are  well specified.&nbsp; Its application to the  rest of the sciences such as biology and its derivatives (which includes the  neurosciences) is a legacy of a mechanical view of the world promoted by  figures such as Rene Descartes. <br />
                <br />
                The success of Isaac Newton&rsquo;s mechanics in describing the behavior of  objects in motion inspired scientists of all disciplines to follow the same  paradigm, which is why physics (where this methodology works best) is  considered &lsquo;king&rsquo; among the sciences, and the rest (such as chemistry) are  &lsquo;runners-up,&rsquo; or even &lsquo;beggars,&rsquo; such as the social sciences (for example psychology,  anthropology or sociology).&nbsp; In truth,  reductionism is a failed paradigm that only works with simple systems, such as  watches, or truly mechanical ones in which there is no synergistic connection  between the components.&nbsp; For example,  there is nothing in the atom of hydrogen, a gas, or in the molecule of oxygen,  another gas, to indicate that the two would combine to form water, a liquid that  becomes solid at zero degrees centigrade or gas at a hundred degrees &ndash; nothing at  all no matter how well you understood oxygen and hydrogen in isolation.&nbsp; Another example &ndash; there is nothing in the  pure physiology of a tiger, as opposed to that of a lion, no matter how much  you study them under a scalpel, that would reveal that one lives in social  prides whereas the other is a jealously solitary predator.&nbsp; Only in the context of their natural  environments can you appreciate this about the lion and tiger.<br /> 
                &nbsp;<br />
                In my inquiries into graduate programs two things became clear.&nbsp; First, there was no set program of study that  would allow me to develop the direction of investigation, of research, that I  wanted.&nbsp; Second, even if there was such a  program I wouldn&rsquo;t have the necessary background to follow it &ndash; a Bachelor&rsquo;s  degree in Spanish and Latin American Studies and a Master&rsquo;s degree in Spanish  and Latin American Literature were of no use to continuing in the field of  neuroscience.&nbsp; With respect to the first  problem there was nothing I could do in the short term other than to continue  looking, but as far as the second one, yes. I enrolled in a Bachelor&rsquo;s program  in general sciences at the University of Waterloo that would allow me to pursue a Doctorate  program once I managed to find one.&nbsp; I  took the prerequisite courses for medicine: organic chemistry, biochemistry,  biophysics of organic systems, molecular biophysics, genetics and molecular  genetics, human physiology, physiological psychology, etc., and I managed to  add a sub-specialization in the field pf psychology of religion.<br />
                <br />
                As a caged bird that has tasted the open skies, one who has managed to  break the ultra-human habit of self-delusion, does not turn back.&nbsp; I was committed to follow a path no matter  where it led, and where I stood now was at the base of a great mountain for which  I couldn&rsquo;t even see the peak.&nbsp; I had to  resort to a more indirect tactic &ndash; instead of looking for programs interested  in studying something so obscure it was even difficult to describe over the  phone, I had to find the best program that would prepare me for a future post-Doctoral  study if necessary.&nbsp; All indications were  that the best field was an old friend, the cognitive sciences, but this time in  a department world-renowned for the quality of its program for it was they who  had practically invented the discipline: the Cognitive Science Program at the University of California at San Diego.&nbsp; A  neural science professor who had advised me at the University of Toronto had confided in me that to approach a program  of that caliber with such a &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; idea as studying the neurophysiology of the  shamanic journey would be academic suicide.&nbsp;  I had to have a more discrete plan.&nbsp;  So, in 1995 I left Kingston, Ontario Canada for San Diego, California with no more than some discrete contacts in my newly chosen Department  and a strategic plan in mind.</p>
